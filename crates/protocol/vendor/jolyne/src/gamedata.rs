//! Game data captured during client login sequence.

//! This module contains the bounded subset of game definition packets required
//! to complete the login/spawn sequence. Optional definition packets remain in
//! the play queue so callers can decode them under their normal work budgets.

/// - Block runtime ID mappings (`block_properties` in `start_game`)
/// - Item registry definitions

/// Optional creative, biome, and entity-definition packets are preserved in
/// FIFO order for the play session instead of being eagerly decoded at login.
