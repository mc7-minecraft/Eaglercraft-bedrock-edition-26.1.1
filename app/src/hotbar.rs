//! Local hotbar slot selection.
//!
//! Bedrock owns hotbar-slot selection on the client: number keys, the mouse wheel, and the
//! controller cycle buttons change the held slot immediately (predicted locally so the HUD
//! highlight follows input without waiting for the server), and the choice is announced upstream
//! with a `PlayerHotbar` packet.
