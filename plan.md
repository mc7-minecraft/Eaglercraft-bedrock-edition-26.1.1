# Rust Bedrock Client (Bevy + Go Core) — Master Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** This is a program-level master plan. Phases 1–8 are sub-projects;
> each gets its own detailed task-by-task plan (per superpowers:writing-plans) when its turn
> comes, executed via superpowers:subagent-driven-development or superpowers:executing-plans.
> Phase 0 is fully detailed here and is executable directly.

**Goal:** A performant, vanilla-parity Minecraft Bedrock client for macOS/Linux/Windows that
joins current third-party servers (RakNet), Realms and friend worlds (NetherNet), and creates
local worlds — built as a Rust/Bevy renderer in front of a Go core derived from Lunar.

**Architecture:** The Rust client owns everything visual and interactive (rendering, world
model, input, UI, audio, one pinned protocol codec). The Go core owns everything network and
identity (Xbox/PlayFab auth, RakNet, NetherNet, Realms, friends, protocol conversion,
resource-pack negotiation), reusing gophertunnel/go-xsapi/go-nethernet unchanged. They talk
over a local byte-stream socket (UDS on macOS/Linux; named pipe or 127.0.0.1 TCP on Windows)
carrying plain Bedrock packets pinned to ONE protocol version, plus a small control channel.
Local worlds run dragonfly behind the same core, over the same client path.

**Tech Stack:**
- Client: Rust, Bevy (wgpu), rayon (meshing), axolotl-stack `valentine` packet defs (1.26.30)
- Core: Go, `lunar` gophertunnel + go-raknet fork; upstream `df-mc/go-nethernet` and `df-mc/go-xsapi/v2`; dragonfly
- Boundary: socket-file transport already implemented in `bedrock-mc/plugin` (reference impl)
- Assets: Mojang/bedrock-samples (full vanilla resource pack); `refs/pocketmine/bds-data`
  for server data (`definitions/`, `blocks.json`) and a live BDS test server

## Global Constraints

- Pinned loopback protocol version: **1.26.30** (bumps are deliberate, lockstep with a core release; the core's gophertunnel protocol conversion absorbs upstream server version variance).
- The Rust side NEVER implements auth, encryption-to-upstream, RakNet-to-upstream, or NetherNet. If a task seems to need one of those in Rust, the task is wrong.
- The loopback game channel is Bedrock packets with length-prefixed framing; no RakNet on this leg. Encryption on this leg: whatever gophertunnel's Listener does by default — do not fork to remove it; AES on loopback is negligible.
- Single source of truth for protocol/data lives in the Go estate: packet truth = gophertunnel (validated against Mojang bedrock-protocol-docs via `cmd/protocoldrift`); block/item/biome registries = generated exports from dragonfly; client packet defs = valentine (docs-generated), conformance-tested against gophertunnel bytes.
- New Go types get doc comments at creation (contract on the type, one-liner per method).
- `lunar` gains at most ONE new consumer (the core). Respect the frozen-facade/ABI rules in `platform/Lunar/AGENTS.md`.
- **Go relay source rule:** copy Lunar's `lunar/internal/relay/relay.go` package logic and
  its relay tests into this repository's Go core (target: `core/internal/relay`), recording
  the exact Lunar source commit. Preserve its forwarding, transfer, resource-pack, and
  lifecycle behavior. Replace only its tiny `lunar/utils` panic-helper dependency with a
  local equivalent. **Do not import `github.com/lunar-bedrock/lunar` or add Lunar as a Go
  module dependency; the copied relay package is the only Lunar code the core consumes.**
- Never edit anything under `refs/` (read-only).
- Vanilla-behaviour parity is the spec language; no decompile/RE provenance in code, commits, or public docs.
- Model routing (per workspace CLAUDE.md): bulk/mechanical implementation → gpt-5.5 via codex skills; anything user-facing (UI, menus, copy) and plan/impl reviews → fable-5/opus-4.8 taste bar.

## Repos and Layout

- **`bedrock-mc/client`** (new greenfield repo; do not reuse `bedrock-mc/Rust-LCE` code, assets, renderer, or world model because it targets the Legacy Console Edition rather than current Bedrock/BDS data):
  - `crates/protocol/` — vendored/generated valentine 1.26.30 defs + login-sequence state machine
  - `crates/world/` — chunk store, sub-chunk decode, block registry, light engine
  - `crates/render/` — meshing, atlas, chunk/entity/sky rendering (Bevy plugins)
  - `crates/sim/` — movement physics (bedsim-parity port)
  - `crates/assets/` — vanilla + server resource-pack loading (models, textures, sounds, lang, fonts)
  - `crates/ui/` — menus, HUD, inventory, forms, chat
  - `crates/bridge/` — socket transport (from `bedrock-mc/plugin`) + control-channel client
  - `app/` — the Bevy application binary
  - `core/` — **Go module**: the core service; copy/adapt Lunar's relay package and logic as donor code, but never import Lunar as a module dependency
  - `tools/` — Go: registry/asset exporters, conformance fixture generator
- **`platform/Lunar`** — small additions only: anything the core needs exposed through the facade; conformance fixture corpus generator may live in `cmd/`.
- **Decision log** (settled in design discussion, 2026-07-09/10): hybrid over pure-Rust (single protocol treadmill, reuse of auth/NetherNet/Realms/physics estate) and over pure-Go (renderer ecosystem); docs-generated codec over gophertunnel-AST codegen (docs are machine-emitted wire descriptions; gophertunnel Marshal funcs are not generatable); socket file over TCP loopback (permissions, no ports); valentine defs adopted as-is for v1 (Hashim PR'd 1.26.30 to axolotl) — vendor/fork decision deferred until Phase 1; conformance harness deferred to Phase 1 (Phase 0 spike acts as the manual conformance test).

## Risk Register (tracked, each owned by a phase)

| Risk | Phase | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Bevy meshing/frame-pacing insufficient | 0 | Spike acceptance gates the whole program |
| valentine defs drift from gophertunnel bytes | 0→1 | Spike surfaces; Phase 1 builds automated conformance harness |
| Dragonfly registry sequential IDs differ from valentine protocol-1001 palette IDs | 1→2 | Resolved: validated runtime assets now derive the unique canonical air identity for both sequential (`13094`) and hashed (`0xdbf44120`) sessions; the checked-in BREG→compiler→blob regression prevents stale protocol constants from turning air into diagnostic geometry on third-party servers |
| Client-side lighting (Bedrock sends no light data) is a full subsystem | 2 | Scoped task; flood-fill block/sky light, correctness vs vanilla screenshots |
| Molang/entity animation scope explosion | 4 | v1 = molang subset for vanilla mobs; static fallback pose; explicit cut-line |
| Sound binaries not fully in bedrock-samples | 8 | Audited against pinned `v1.26.30.32-preview-full`: 1,815 definitions reference 1,497 unique paths, with 185 binaries absent (94 Nether ambience, 87 gameplay music, 4 menu music); effects are substantially source-unblocked, while the missing ambience/music still requires a lawful local-client import or fallback |
| Windows transport (no tokio UDS) | 1 | Transport behind trait/enum; named pipe or TCP flavor chosen at startup |
| axolotl-stack bus factor | 1 | Vendor valentine output (generated code) into `crates/protocol`; upstream fixes when friendly |
| dragonfly vanilla worldgen parity | 7 | v1 local worlds = dragonfly's gen as-is; parity gaps documented, not chased |
| Bevy 0.x quarterly breaking releases | all | Pin per phase; upgrade as a deliberate task, never mid-phase |

## Current integration snapshot (2026-07-16)

This ledger is the authoritative hand-off for the current branch audit. The audit base is
clean `render-integration` commit `1ac547b`, published exactly as
`github/phase2-textures`; the last functional implementation commit before the workflow
documentation is `efa5400`. The agent runtime does not expose exact model/version or effort
selectors, so reviews use the configured runtime default rather than claiming a particular
model setting.

At audit time the repository had 65 linked worktrees. Twenty-five worktree heads were
ancestors of the audit base, 26 more were patch-equivalent or historical, and 14 had
patch-unique commits. The three genuine candidates and their current disposition are:

| Tranche | Base -> head | Review/integration state | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 3 movement foundation | `efa5400` -> `71d38a3` | Integrated history-preservingly as merge `e370880`; focused and full locked workspace tests, strict Clippy, formatting, and architecture enforcement are green | Keep production outbound movement disabled while FreeCamera is active; finish the remaining movement strata and live server-authoritative acceptance before enabling `Physics` transmission |
| Phase 2.6 leaf litter | `efa5400` -> `698be1c` (`phase26-leaf-litter`) | Preserved on its feature branch, review **needs changes**, and deliberately unmerged | Deferred until further authoritative state-to-visual data is available; retain the branch and finish this exact family with the other residual visual-authority work last |
| Phase 4 entity geometry carrier | `105107d` -> `4a6696b` | Integrated history-preservingly as merges `1e4ba3c` and `73b8de7` after three Important parser/inheritance findings were fixed, the complete behavior range received fresh APPROVE, and the policy-compliant module split received a separate APPROVE | Consume the bounded geometry/bone/cube payloads in runtime rigs; animation clips, Molang/controller evaluation, GPU posing, and native animated-actor evidence remain open |

Phase status at this audit:

| Gate | Accurate state |
|---|---|
| Phase 2.5 biome blending | Open: the provisional 3x3 blend kernel still needs an abrupt native biome-boundary comparison and live acceptance |
| Phase 2.6 visual coverage | Open: the production carrier has zero diagnostic states, but 2,397 non-air states across 487 names use an explicitly provisional vanilla fallback. This removes pink vanilla blocks without claiming exact geometry/UV parity; each fallback remains an open acceptance item |
| Phase 2.7 lighting/sky/fog/clouds | Open: the cloud evidence sub-gate is complete, but calibrated atmosphere parity, native cloud/celestial comparison, and the <=2 s teleport-remesh gate remain open |
| Phase 3 movement | Packet/simulation foundations plus the reviewed PR #6 input-parity and correction/acceptance lanes are integrated through merge `a9593e7`. Implementation and deterministic verification are complete, but native/live, performance, and touch-parity acceptance remain open. By owner decision touch is deprioritized and does not gate Phase 3 acceptance; the scenario records it as deferred rather than satisfied. Production outbound `Physics` transmission remains intentionally disabled pending a separate reviewed change |
| Phase 4 actors | Actor tracking, standard-skin biped rendering, Oomph-style three-tick player convergence, distinct per-frame render interpolation, and the bounded MCBEENT3 geometry/bone/cube carrier are complete. Runtime rig consumption, animations/Molang, persona/custom rendering, legacy/outer skin layers, and remaining entity families are still open |

Nine other patch-unique branch heads were audited as superseded/reimplemented and were
deleted locally after their authoritative replacements were verified: local `phase2-textures`
copper work, `phase27-atmosphere-parity-fix`,
`phase2-block-entity-manifest`, `repair-mushroom-typed`, `phase27-light-core`,
`phase27-light-scheduler`, `phase3-physics-fix-resume`, `phase26-static-signs`, and
`transparent-model-stream`. Two more, `fix/frustum-culling` and
`phase26-wood-shelves`, were obsolete/withdrawn and were also deleted locally. The remote
`github/phase2-textures` integration branch was not deleted.

Five worktrees contain preserved, uncommitted work and are intentionally not cleaned by this
audit: the root `cinnabar-work`, `external-mode-diagnostic`, `blockentity-evidence`,
`atmosphere-black-diagnosis`, and `static-fence-gates`. Their changes are not part of the
three integration candidates above.

## Current execution order (2026-07-16)

The exact leaf-litter route and any other residual family that lacks sufficient
state-to-visual authority are deferred until further authoritative data is available. Keep
their feature work isolated and unmerged; already integrated and verified Phase 2.6 families
remain in place. Continue with work that does not depend on that missing authority, in this
order:

1. **Phase 2.7 runtime and visual closure:** first run the fresh release/BDS trace for the
   already integrated adaptive chunk application/upload scheduler, then tune the stage that
   trace proves is still preventing the <=2 s teleport-remesh gate. Follow with the
   identical-scene FIFO/Immediate visibility witness and any proven void-band source, then
   native celestial and finite-cloud parity acceptance.
2. **Phase 2.5 biome blending evidence:** the bounded provisional 3x3 implementation is already
   integrated. Measure a version-matched native abrupt biome boundary to determine its radius,
   offsets, weights, and colour space; change the CPU/WGSL kernel only if that evidence disproves
   it, then close matching-scene GPU/live and performance acceptance.
3. **Phase 4.3 entity rigs and animation:** consume the integrated bounded geometry carrier,
   extend the already integrated pinned animation/controller catalog with bounded animation-clip
   payloads, implement the reviewed Molang/controller subset and shared runtime posing, and prove
   animated players/mobs without per-actor resource churn.
4. **Phase 4.4 actor acceptance:** close live ground contact plus the distinct three-tick
   network convergence and adjacent-frame render interpolation witness.
5. **Phase 3 movement completion:** add the remaining simulation strata and live
   server-authoritative acceptance before enabling outbound movement from `Physics`; keep
   `FreeCamera` network-silent.
6. **Phase 5 UI:** implement the UI foundation, receive-only text/HUD, chat, scoreboard and
   boss bars, inventory/interaction, and forms in the numbered 5.1-5.7 order.
7. **Deferred final Phase 2.6 authority pass:** return to leaf litter and other exact residual
   visual families only when further authoritative state selectors, geometry/UV, rotation,
   layer, tint, animation, and occlusion data are available. Re-review, verify, integrate, and
   measure the production diagnostic ratchet family-by-family; do not infer ambiguous mappings.

### PR 6 cache-enabled live-validation handoff (2026-08-01)

The local `agent/track-phase3-movement` implementation through `7d89ff5` is ahead
of its pushed remote (`d8637a2`), independently approved, and ready to push for
CI/merge; it is not yet pushed or integrated. Cache-enabled BDS load exposed and
fixed a self-sustaining blob-recovery loop, unbounded publication-authority scans,
repeated per-frame cohort hashing, scheduler starvation, intra-transaction relight
cascades, and the requested-cohort boundary stall. Optimized-dev BDS run
`.local/acceptance/phase3-018ae154de9b40cb8f12aea378c48752` reached zero
pending/in-flight light and mesh work across a stable 939/939-column cohort:
8,130 resident meshes, 5,416 submitted/GPU-completed meshes, 33,205 accepted
light jobs, and zero stale light jobs. The inspected Windows scene was complete.
After the final visibility-cache optimizations, run
`.local/acceptance/phase3-33bd062a9cc04078b8ffeb68573d7746` measured idle
frames at 10.272 ms median (the 100 FPS VSync ceiling), zero-byte publication at
23.061 ms median, and payload publication at 29.836 ms median. Active chunk
publication still causes visible frame drops and remains explicit follow-up work.
This closes the blank-window and visible-radius convergence regressions; it does
**not** close release-performance or vanilla-lighting-parity gates.

An authenticated private local clone of `ethaniccc/bds-replica` now exists outside
this repository at `C:/Users/Hashim/Projects/bds-replica`. Its address-backed
1.16.201 recovery notes are a potentially authoritative native Bedrock reference,
but the repository declares no license and targets protocol 422. Do not copy its
source or redistribute it; obtain the author's explicit permission, cite the exact
reference revision/address evidence, verify version stability, and independently
implement any adopted contract. Its recovered original-lighting path uses a
retained 3x3-column transaction and one priority-32 center-column task rather than
the current provisional per-subchunk scheduler.

The current column transaction solves contiguous vertical work against retained
3x3 subchunk snapshots, retains immutable generations, and admits requested
cohort-edge columns without waiting forever for unrequested neighbours. It does
**not** yet reproduce vanilla's atomic 3x3-column ownership, cross-column writes,
or 500 ms lock-contention retry, so it remains an explicitly incomplete
convergence architecture and cannot close the native lighting-parity gate.
Audit the full architecture before further queue-cap tuning. Remaining measured
follow-ups are active-publication frame pacing, release-mode performance,
version-matched native comparison, and the native atomic lighting architecture.

## Phase 0 — Spike: prove the stack end-to-end (DETAILED, executable now)

**Goal:** Bevy app connects through a core process to a real server, decodes chunks with
valentine defs, meshes and renders a 16-chunk radius with acceptable frame pacing.
**This phase gates the program.** Failure modes and their outs: defs drift → fix
gophertunnel/defs (expected, fine); frame pacing fails → revisit meshing strategy before
any other phase proceeds.

**Files:**
- Create: `bedrock-mc/client` repo — `app/` (Bevy spike), `crates/protocol/`, `crates/bridge/`, `core/` (minimal Go main)
- Reference (do not modify): `bedrock-mc/plugin` (socket transport), `platform/pc-client` (lunar embedding), `libs/gophertunnel/minecraft/dial.go`, `libs/dragonfly` `chunk` package (sub-chunk decode reference)
- Test server: `refs/pocketmine/bds-data/bedrock_server-1.26.32.2` (run a local BDS) or a dev Lunar upstream

**Interfaces (produced for later phases):**
- `core/`: Go binary `bedrock-core` — flags `-socket-dir <dir> -upstream <host:port>`; listens with `minecraft.Listener` on the socket transport, dials upstream via `minecraft.Dialer`, forwards packets both ways at pinned protocol (this is a ~200-line pc-client-shaped proxy main for the spike; productized in Phase 1)
- `crates/bridge`: `fn connect(socket_dir: &Path) -> anyhow::Result<FramedStream>` where `FramedStream: Stream<Item=Bytes> + Sink<Bytes>` (length-prefixed batches)
- `crates/protocol`: `fn decode_batch(bytes) -> Vec<Packet>`, `fn encode(packet) -> Bytes`, `enum Packet` (valentine-generated), plus `LoginSequence` state machine: `RequestNetworkSettings → Login (self-signed chain, no XBL) → handshake → ResourcePackClientResponse (decline/none for spike) → await StartGame → RequestChunkRadius(16) → await spawn → SetLocalPlayerAsInitialized`
- `crates/world` (spike-minimal): `SubChunk::decode(&[u8]) -> SubChunk` (paletted storages), `Chunk { sub_chunks: Vec<SubChunk> }`

**Tasks (each = write failing test → run → implement → pass → commit):**

- [x] **0.1 Repo scaffold.** Cargo workspace + `core/` Go module; CI stub (`cargo test`, `go test ./...`). Complete at `41112b2` (review clean).
- [x] **0.2 Spike core proxy.** Complete at `823bf49` (live BDS join passed; lifecycle hardening review clean). Go: socket-transport `net.Listener` (port from `bedrock-mc/plugin`) + `minecraft.ListenConfig{AuthenticationDisabled: true}` + upstream `minecraft.Dialer` forwarding loop. Test: Go integration test dials the socket with gophertunnel's own client, joins local BDS through it. Run: `go test ./core/... -run TestProxyJoin -count=1`. This test is load-bearing: it proves the core path with a known-good client before Rust enters.
- [x] **0.3 Bridge crate.** Complete at `7ce7309` (17 Rust unit tests + Go echo integration; review approved). Rust: connect + framing. Test: echo fixture against a Go test binary serving the same transport. `cargo test -p bridge`.
- [x] **0.4 Protocol crate: vendored defs + decode smoke.** Complete at `a7bbfac` (five exact gophertunnel fixtures; review approved). Vendor valentine 1.26.30 generated output. Test: decode a fixture corpus of gophertunnel-encoded packets (generate fixtures with a small Go tool in `tools/fixturegen` — encode one of each: NetworkSettings, StartGame, LevelChunk, MovePlayer, AddActor). Any decode failure here = defs/gophertunnel drift: adjudicate against bedrock-protocol-docs, fix gophertunnel upstream or patch defs, record in `crates/protocol/DEVIATIONS.md`.
- [x] **0.5 Login sequence.** Complete at `1fa35ee` (encrypted Rust bridge login, strict protocol-1001 conformance fixtures, bounded malformed-input handling, independent review approved). `LoginSequence` reaches StartGame through the spike core. With `BEDROCK_BDS_DIR` set, `cargo test -p protocol --test login --locked -- --nocapture` builds the Go external-client harness, starts/stops core+BDS itself, and verifies clean shutdown.
- [x] **0.6 Sub-chunk decode.** Complete at `7d9248a` (12 reproducible goldens from pinned Dragonfly, packed/paletted v1/v8/v9 decode, atomic sparse chunk ingestion, 28 Rust world tests, three independent reviews approved). Runtime storage remains palette + packed words and preserves high-bit network block hashes without a flat per-block array.
- [x] **0.7 Spike renderer.** Complete at `f2a6a1c` (400 Rust tests, strict all-target Clippy, independent review approved, and live fly/input pass recorded). First extend `crates/world` with packed-palette `UpdateBlock`/`UpdateSubChunkBlocks` mutation and full-column eviction APIs; expand each changed key through `mesh_dependents` before remeshing. Bevy app: consume LevelChunk and SubChunk responses → decode → cull-meshing on rayon → vertex buffers → draw untextured (per-runtime-ID debug colors); fly camera. Pure meshing remains unit-tested. Use Computer Use for a live interaction pass covering window focus/capture, keyboard inputs, fly movement on every axis, mouse-look yaw/pitch, and clean input release (no stuck movement or rotation); the acceptance run below remains the end-to-end renderer gate.
- [ ] **0.8 Acceptance run.** Connect to BDS world, render 16-chunk radius, fly at speed, break/place blocks from a second client to force live remeshing. Repeat the Task 0.7 Computer Use interaction checklist in the live streamed world and record the result. Before the run, resolve the recorded `AvailableCommands` live drift and add/fix `MaterialReducer` output-count conformance coverage from `crates/protocol/DEVIATIONS.md`. **Gate: p99 frame time ≤ 8ms on the dev MacBook at 16 chunks; remesh of a modified sub-chunk visible ≤ 100ms; zero decode errors over a 15-minute session (or all errors adjudicated as 0.4-style findings and fixed).** Record numbers in the phase report.
  - Historical Windows evidence at `3898530` passed: 900.0015 s, radius 16/16/16, p99 5.1 ms, 432/432 visible mutations, max mutation-to-visible 45.4522 ms, zero decode errors, clean shutdown. At that revision Phase 0 was **CONDITIONAL GO**, pending only the authoritative dev MacBook p99 run.
  - **Current-candidate performance audit (2026-08-02, local and uncommitted):**
    a release baseline at `.local/acceptance/20260802T174927Z-10764` recorded
    p50/p95/p99 frame times of 13.4/17.3/60.8 ms and 263.79 ms maximum
    mutation-to-visible latency. The audited candidate enables thin LTO with one
    codegen unit, avoids unchanged extraction/GPU scans, reuses neighbour palette
    resolution, skips model voxel scans when the palette has no model geometry,
    reuses render-queue sorting storage, uses bounded direct deflate reads, and
    removes avoidable acceptance-diagnostics work. It also replaces runtime
    SipHash maps/sets only where keys are already bounded internal identities;
    untrusted/network-key maps retain their existing hashers.
  - The environment-gated stage profiler is retained as durable attribution
    telemetry. Instrumented run
    `.local/acceptance/20260802T191930Z-2188` passed the complete Windows gate
    with p50/p95/p99 10.0/14.0/14.9 ms, 76.9395 ms maximum
    mutation-to-visible latency, zero decode errors, and drained light/mesh
    queues. A later final-source profile attributed wall time primarily to
    transparent preparation (15.17%), the transparent worker (9.09%), cave
    visibility (8.57%), and opaque queue preparation (6.38%); chunk extraction,
    GPU preparation, and render-queue application were each below 1%.
  - Two consecutive uninstrumented final-source runs
    (`20260802T213056Z-4332`, `20260802T213439Z-8848`) passed the complete
    Windows gate with p50 10.2 ms, p95 17.0-18.2 ms, p99 22.8-31.7 ms,
    maximum mutation-to-visible latency 76.9016-86.3247 ms, and zero decode
    errors. Live block mutations now retain urgent priority through lighting,
    meshing, publication, and GPU upload; changes whose old and new palettes
    have identical emission/filter semantics skip redundant relighting. Maximum
    remesh latency was 78.9989-119.2461 ms. Phase 0 remains **CONDITIONAL GO**
    pending the authoritative dev MacBook p99 run; the Windows mutation and
    decode gates are cleared by these repeated final-source runs.

**Exit criteria:** acceptance gate met; deviations documented; go/no-go written up. Everything after this phase is "build the game", with the architecture de-risked.

---

## Phase 1 — Core service (Go): productize the boundary

**Goal:** `bedrock-core` becomes a real service the client can ship: session lifecycle, auth,
control channel, conformance harness. Deliverable proof: a headless Go CLI (`corectl`) can
device-code-auth, list Realms/friends, and join any of the three transport targets through
the core — before any more Rust exists.

Scope (detailed plan to be written at phase start):
- Control channel on `control.sock`: protobuf or JSON-RPC; methods — `Status`, `StartAuth` (device-code events streamed), `SignOut`, `ListServers`, `ListRealms`, `ListFriends` (gophertunnel realms package + go-xsapi sessions; the join side of what go-mcxboxbroadcast does), `Connect{target}`, `Disconnect`; events — auth state, connection state, transfer notices, disconnect reasons.
- Session lifecycle: begin by copying Lunar's `lunar/internal/relay/relay.go` and relay tests
  into `core/internal/relay`, adapting only imports/helpers needed to make the package
  standalone. The core uses that relay logic to dial upstream (RakNet / NetherNet via Xbox
  signaling / Realms address), serve the game socket, and handle transfers. Lunar remains a
  source donor, never a module dependency.
- Resource-pack negotiation upstream; pack payloads handed to client over the control channel as files in a cache dir (client applies them — Phase 6 renders them).
- Windows transport flavor (named pipe or TCP) behind the same listener interface.
- **Conformance harness (promoted from deferral):** `tools/fixturegen` grows to full packet coverage; CI job round-trips gophertunnel↔valentine bytes both directions on every core and defs bump. This is the automated version of spike task 0.4.
- Consumer-surface work in `platform/Lunar` to expose what the core needs through the facade (measured, minimal, per AGENTS.md ABI rules).

**Early authenticated RakNet smoke (Zeqa):**

- [x] Add an explicit, ignored Microsoft token cache and optional authenticated upstream
  dial mode while preserving the offline BDS path when `-auth-cache` is omitted.
- [x] Document the exact `bedrock-core` and release `bedrock-client` commands, device-code
  stdout flow, cache privacy requirements, and Rust → local socket → Go → RakNet boundary.
- [x] Report the core's startup lifecycle synchronously: Go build start, process/auth state,
  published local endpoint, local Rust-client acceptance, and upstream connect/success/failure.
  Commit `46a4e9f` covers ordered, secret-safe logging and fatal-startup tests.
- [x] Live smoke: authenticate `bedrock-core` to `zeqa.net:19132` with
  `.local/auth/microsoft-token.json` and confirm the current release client reaches Zeqa.
- [x] Record non-secret live evidence below; never record the device code, access token,
  refresh token, or token-cache contents.

Live evidence:

- Date/time: 2026-07-11 19:17 PDT
- Authenticated upstream connection observed: yes; the authenticated protocol-1001 entry
  connection returned Zeqa's pre-login transfer to `pvp.inpvp.net:19132`, and the bounded
  core transfer follower completed the regional connection.
- Client reached Zeqa lobby/session: yes; the release client reached position
  `(-117.50, 87.62, 195.50)`, streamed `1105/5376` chunks while the count continued rising,
  and held approximately 100 FPS. A native Windows screenshot was inspected from the user
  temp directory and was not added to the repository.
- Credential hygiene (`git ls-files .local` empty; no credential material in retained logs):
  passed. The token cache remained inside the ignored `.local/` tree, its contents were never
  inspected, and the temporary device-code stdout log was removed after authentication.

This early direct-RakNet smoke does not close the phase-wide control-channel, `corectl`,
Realms, friends, NetherNet, general/post-login transfer, or sign-out work above.

Exit: `corectl join --friend <gamertag>` works from a clean machine; conformance CI green.

## Phase 2 — World rendering (textured, lit, real)

**Goal:** the spike renderer becomes the real world pipeline. Deliverable: fly through any
live server world and it *looks like Minecraft*.

Scope: block registry + block-state → model/texture mapping (generated export from Dragonfly's registry via `tools/registrygen`, shipped as a binary asset, pinned PMMP BedrockData as the exact protocol-1001 canonical palette/property/biome cross-check, Axolotl Valentine's versioned typed-state approach as a state-selector/catalog reference, and Axolotl's exact pinned PrismarineJS Bedrock collision shapes as reviewed cuboid-template/occlusion inputs—not render/UV authority); vanilla asset ingestion from **Mojang/bedrock-samples** pinned to the matching game version (terrain textures, `blocks.json`, flipbooks, and biome colors) — NOTE: the pinned samples contain no block-render model JSON, so deterministic reviewed family generators combine these sources and vanilla-reference evidence; BDS `resource_packs/vanilla` is server-minimal (blocks.json + texts only), a data reference rather than the texture source; 2D texture array pages + per-layer mipmaps; greedy/culled meshing with transparency layers (opaque/cutout/blend) and per-face culling; **client-side light engine** (block + sky flood-fill, per-vertex light, day/night); biome tinting (grass/foliage/water); sky, fog, clouds; chunk streaming/eviction tied to `ChunkRadiusUpdated` + `SubChunk` request flow; block entities with custom renderers deferred (chests/signs get static models in this phase). Zuri is not a rendering or asset-system input.

**Phase 2 progress (kept current as work lands):**

- [x] **Sequential/hash third-party block identity compatibility.** Runtime
  classification derives canonical air from the validated compiled registry
  instead of the stale protocol bootstrap constant. The checked-in production
  path proves sequential air `13094` and hashed air `0xdbf44120`, rejects
  ambiguous/decoy AIR records, and covers both `WorldStream` modes. This closes
  the all-pink-air failure seen on sequential-ID third-party servers while
  preserving hashed servers.
- [x] **2.1 Local-only vanilla source and deterministic asset pipeline.** Pinned
  `bedrock-samples` provenance, Dragonfly registry export, pack parsing, bounded
  compiler, per-layer mips, versioned runtime blob, and diagnostic fallback are
  implemented; Mojang payloads remain ignored.
- [x] **2.2 Opaque full-cube render path.** Material-aware binary greedy meshing,
  exact eight-byte quads, one shared material buffer/texture array/bind group,
  vertex-pulled repeating UVs, oriented faces, and live asset selection are
  implemented. Two current-HEAD 60-second Windows radius-16 runs passed with
  p99 4.1 ms and zero errors; see `docs/phase-2-texture-slice-report.md`.
- [ ] **2.3 Close the opaque texture slice.** The deterministic named-block BDS
  gallery now passes with all faces/log axes, greedy repetition, mips, supported
  and diagnostic cases recorded, and the clean no-assets full gate passes. The
  fail-closed material path, local relay 1,600-packet ceiling, and deterministic
  inbound/command network arbitration are implemented and independently reviewed.
  A 2026-07-11 interactive radius-16 run at `00b7a32` reached world-ready with
  zero missing mappings, but is diagnostic rather than acceptance evidence:
  849,117 rendered quads used material zero across 9,040 resident/7,093 visible
  subchunks, and exact inspection of blob SHA-256
  `1fbd361c489d3cf90edb49c0056b83ffd9a2a114a36ac1eaf28cfd1103ecf508`
  found only 661 of 16,913 registry visuals
  mapped to real materials. Evidence is in
  `.local/acceptance/20260711T192110Z-16912/app.stdout.log`. Most of that visible gap
  belongs to Tasks 2.4–2.7 (leaves, tint/grass, water/blend, and models). The exact
  two-second teleport/full-view remesh gate and fresh combined RSS/steady-CPU
  evidence remain open; close those findings before completing Task 8.
- [ ] **2.4 Cutout cube materials and leaves.** Preserve independent geometry,
  occlusion, and cave-connectivity semantics; keep the packed subchunk/quad and
  shared GPU architecture. Tasks 1–4/5 are complete at `f768cfa`, `4d23356`,
  `f33b71c`, and `8391a58`: the versioned
  registry now exports independent air, cube-geometry, full-face-occlusion,
  and leaf-model facts with exact pinned counts, and leaf-only cutout materials
  now use coverage-preserving per-layer mips. Palette-native `u64` meshing now
  applies ordered leaf/opaque culling and non-occluder cave connectivity without
  widening the eight-byte quad. The existing single opaque shader now applies
  bit-8 alpha cutout with depth writes and no blending. No Mojang payload is
  tracked. The deterministic live-evidence task remains open.
- [ ] **2.5 Biome palettes and tinting.** `P2.5-NATIVE-BIOME` Decode/store biome data and apply
  grass/foliage/water tint without widening the eight-byte quad record.
  - [x] Palette-native v1001 biome storage/column decoding, including padded
    Bedrock words, `0xff` previous-storage reuse, strict malformed-input
    rejection, atomic inline block+biome commits, and biome-only column
    lifetime independent of all-air block subchunks.
  - [x] Carry request-mode and inline `LevelChunk` biome payloads through the
    Rayon/FIFO streaming path, decode the full dimension column independently
    of requested block count, and commit it before subchunk requests.
  - [x] Retain the live biome definition mapping needed to resolve palette IDs
    to climate and vanilla tint rules, including bounded custom-biome fallback.
  - [x] Remove the grass-block diagnostic fallback: compile bottom/top/side
    independently, preserve grass-side alpha as an opaque tint mask through
    mip generation, and apply the pinned pack's deterministic default grass
    tint until live per-biome color lookup replaces it.
  - [x] Compile grass/foliage/water tint classifications and biome color rules,
    upload palette-native biome/tint tables, and apply them in the chunk shader
    without widening the eight-byte quad record. Grass plus generic/birch/
    evergreen/dry foliage are now resolved from `MCBEAS03`, revision-gated,
    and applied palette-natively. **Complete (2026-07-13):** Task 13's real
    animated water route applies the live palette-native water tint in the
    liquid shader without widening the eight-byte cube quad. Native run
    `20260712T203607Z-7596` proved five runtime water tints, consecutive exact
    GPU witnesses, generation 518 presented, p99 14.0 ms, and zero decode
    errors; fresh assets/render/client focused suites remain green.
  - [ ] Add vanilla-reference biome tint blending for grass, foliage, and
    water. Determine the matching Bedrock radius/kernel from native reference
    evidence, sample the bounded palette-native biome neighbourhood across
    chunk boundaries without flattening columns, preserve special foliage
    rules and custom-biome fallback, and cover abrupt-boundary, missing-neighbour,
    teleport/eviction, GPU, and performance cases.
    **Bounded implementation landed; parity evidence remains open (2026-07-14):**
    grass, generic foliage, and water now share a radius-one horizontal 3x3
    linear-colour box blend across self-contained palette-native neighbour
    snapshots. The descriptor deduplicates equal packed payloads, clamps a
    missing neighbour to the center's nearest edge, records a uniform fast path,
    retains direct birch/evergreen/dry-foliage selection, and validates all nine
    immutable source identities before publication so neighbour replacement,
    eviction, and teleport churn fail stale. Request-mode biome-only commits now
    dirty resident cross-column consumers. The eight-byte cube quad and packed
    Bedrock storages remain unchanged; a uniform record is 52 bytes, or
    1,359,072 bytes for 33x33x24 subchunks at radius 16, while the exact
    descriptor ceiling and the existing GPU arena cap bound adversarial palettes.
    The 3x3 kernel is explicitly provisional because no reviewed native Bedrock
    radius/weight evidence was available; keep this checkbox open until a native
    abrupt-boundary reference fixes or confirms the kernel and the live
    performance/visual gate passes.
    **Committed diagnostic contract complete (2026-07-16):** the provisional
    radius, nine-sample count, and denominator are now one explicit CPU/WGSL
    contract over fixed-size packed records, with cross-chunk diagonal samples
    and exact missing-neighbour edge clamping. Acceptance-only
    `BIOME_BLEND_COMMITTED stage=app_committed` telemetry is sourced from the
    immutable camera-subchunk `ChunkRenderInstance` record after world apply and
    binds its key, chunk generation, tint identity/revision, full-record hash,
    local coordinate, and exact sample set. Unchanged identities are deduplicated
    so stationary runs cannot grow logs. This is deliberately not labeled
    GPU-presented evidence. Independent review and full affected tests/strict
    checks are green through merge `a0f08d9`; the native abrupt-boundary and live
    performance/visual adjudication remain the only completion gate.
- [ ] **2.6 Static/non-cube models, blend/water, and flipbooks.** Complete the
  remaining block visual classes and animation path per
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-11-phase-2-6-noncube-water-design.md`.
  - [x] Pin and securely acquire the exact local-only PMMP, PrismarineJS,
    Axolotl, and Dragonfly evidence bundle. Whole-bundle atomic publication,
    byte/hash/time bounds, junction rejection, concurrent-winner handling,
    exact license notices, and the no-tracked-payload contract are complete at
    `c44de03`.
  - [x] Preserve complete bounded flipbook metadata and compile the real pinned
    pack's physical frames into deterministic page-aware staging data without
    changing the v3 runtime schema. Commits `143c68d` and `e6e49e1` cover 83
    animations, 1,209 physical frames, 1,323 timeline references, and 1,901
    deduplicated layers on one 2,048-layer page.
  - [x] Export and strictly decode `BREG1003` typed model/contributor/selectors,
    face coverage, collision seeds, and per-state provenance at `e58d083`.
    PMMP/Dragonfly/Prismarine form a full 16,913-state/1,356-name bijection;
    Valentine is an exact ordered 15,845-state subset with 1,068 attributable
    missing states across 35 wholly absent names and zero extra/mismatched
    states. The deterministic registry SHA-256 is
    `3669be82850824af8592276afe864d903495e743b8af81dfcf1d3aa1586231a4`.
  - [x] Version the bounded runtime asset schema to `MCBEAS04`; compile the
    typed registry selectors, template tables, page-aware flipbook data, and
    attributable per-family diagnostics without committing Mojang payloads.
  - [x] Upload the bounded one/two-page `MCBEAS04` texture resource, immutable
    material/animation/frame tables, and a stable 16-byte animation clock in
    one shared chunk bind group. Commit `a30a0ef` adds page-aware current/next
    frame selection, cross-page interpolation and wraparound, a real diagnostic
    second-page fallback, atomic asset-revision replacement, derivative-safe
    WGSL sampling, and no per-frame texture upload; 82 render tests, strict
    Clippy, and independent spec/quality review are green.
  - [x] Generalize bounded chunk rendering to named cube, model,
    model-lighting, liquid, and liquid-lighting streams while preserving the
    eight-byte greedy cube record. Commit `5734872` adds exact combined byte
    accounting, one consolidated word-addressed geometry arena, transactional
    all-stream allocation/rollback/retry, generation/tint gates, expected/drawn
    presentation masks, and identical direct/MDI addressing. The projected
    vertex storage-binding count including future templates is seven of the
    common minimum eight; 89 render tests, strict Clippy, and independent
    re-review are green.
  - [x] Produce stable eight-byte face-specific model/liquid lighting sidecars
    from a palette-native center-plus-26-neighbour snapshot. Commit `8b5c5a6`
    bakes exact Phase 2.6 block-light 0 / sky-light 15 values plus per-vertex AO,
    registers generation-scoped diagonal AO/liquid dependency masks, and covers
    inline columns, known-air replacement, stale rejection, and conservative
    unknown targets. Render 93/93, world 51/51, client 187/187, strict combined
    Clippy, and independent re-review are green; Phase 2.7 will replace only the
    light inputs, not this format or addressing.
  - [x] Add palette-native multi-layer contributor resolution, retaining the
    eight-byte greedy cube record and adding compact model/liquid streams with
    atomic queue/GPU generation accounting and direct/MDI parity. Task 10 now
    resolves up to 16 packed storage layers without a flat 4,096-block array,
    fails closed on contributor conflicts, and retains simultaneous primary and
    liquid contributors. All three seagrass states and all 26 kelp ages compile
    with exact animated material identities; kelp head/body selection is driven
    only by the primary block above, including across subchunk boundaries. The
    deterministic 29-state BDS water-tank gallery passed from both directions
    at current HEAD with zero target diagnostics/decode errors, p99 15.5 ms,
    377,843,712-byte peak combined RSS, 5.78% mean combined CPU, and native temp
    screenshots confirming real green cutout models. Water geometry remains
    deliberately invisible until Tasks 11–13.
  - [x] Track the exact bounded liquid mesh neighbourhood and invalidation set.
    Task 11 keeps the shared palette-native `world::MeshNeighbourhood` as the
    render API boundary, exposes the deduplicated 23-subchunk liquid sample set
    (current/upper horizontal 3x3 plus lower center and four cardinals),
    applies its checked inverse for liquid-only diagonal dirtying, preserves
    ordinary six-face cube invalidation, coalesces duplicate rapid updates, and
    rejects stale dependency masks. World, client, formatting, strict Clippy,
    and independent review are green; no flat block or whole-column snapshot was
    introduced.
  - [x] Compile crossed cutout plants/crops with exact variants and biome tint;
    compile all physical flipbook frames into texture-array layers and animate
    them from immutable descriptors without per-frame texture uploads. Commit
    `a24370b` covers all 443 terrestrial Cross/Crop states (279 Cross, 164 Crop)
    with zero diagnostics, reusable two-quad templates, compact model refs,
    face-specific lighting, a shared bounded/no-cull direct+MDI GPU path, and an
    exhaustive hash-bound gallery; assets 112, render 102, world 51, client 187,
    acceptance, strict Clippy, and final independent re-review are green.
  - [x] Mesh animated, biome-tinted water from the shared bounded palette
    snapshot. Task 12 preserves all 16 water depth/falling states, vanilla-like
    weighted four-corner surfaces, diagonal and cross-subchunk influence,
    same-water/solid culling, clipped sides and bottoms, signed flow gradients,
    waterlogging, still/flow per-face materials, stable stream order, and one
    face-specific eight-byte lighting sidecar per 16-byte liquid quad. The
    liquid dependency set was corrected to the exact 23 samples needed by
    lower-cardinal waterfall flow. Only all-face alpha-blended, water-tinted
    families enter this stream; lava remains attributable diagnostic until its
    Task 19 depth-writing route. Seventeen liquid integration tests, full locked
    affected-crate suites, exact strict Clippy, real 16,913-visual asset compile,
    and final independent re-review are green. Water remains deliberately
    invisible until Task 13 installs the transparent GPU path.
  - [x] Mesh animated, biome-tinted water with same-liquid culling, vanilla-like
    corner heights, diagonal invalidation, and a correctly ordered transparent
    phase with depth testing and no depth writes. Its deterministic BDS gallery
    requires one real water tint referenced by the committed/presented liquid
    snapshot (BDS commands cannot assign fixture biomes); a separate end-to-end
    app integration test proves two raw biome IDs with distinct map-water
    colours preserve dense lookup and distinct renderer tint records. Water
    visibility churn and generation-only remeshes retain the last ordered
    snapshot only while every absolute address stays physically resident: same
    key/metadata, active tint, valid lighting, and a same-start liquid range
    containing the old range. Moved/shrunk ranges, eviction, metadata reuse, or
    asset/tint replacement use bounded copy-on-write quarantine: retired spans
    remain drawable and unreusable until an empty-or-nonempty replacement frame
    is submitted and its independent GPU retirement epoch completes. Cap
    exhaustion backpressures the update/removal rather than risking stale reads
    or a blank transparent frame.
    Gallery freezes its 60-second duration/frame metrics at the original
    deadline, then permits at most two unmeasured seconds for a non-empty
    committed=encoded=GPU-presented transparent generation; timeout is a
    logged nonzero failure. Its manifested p99 frame-time gate is exactly
    1000/60 ms.
    **Task 13 complete (2026-07-12):** after fixing bounded GPU-upload
    starvation and four-word liquid-stream arena alignment, exact four-key GPU
    witnesses passed repeatedly across `WaterGalleryFront` and
    `WaterGalleryBack`. Commit `38c1f5d` moved the block-constant packed biome
    tint lookup from the fill-heavy liquid fragment stage to a flat vertex
    varying without changing tint, alpha, ordering, uploads, or lifecycle
    bounds. Native run `20260712T203607Z-7596` froze exactly 60 seconds and
    passed at p99 14.0 ms (limit 16.667 ms), with 38,214 transparent refs,
    five runtime water tints, consecutive exact four-key GPU witnesses,
    request=result=committed=encoded=presented generation 518, zero ceiling
    rejects, zero decode errors, radius 16, 414,187,520-byte peak combined RSS,
    and 6.438% mean combined CPU. Full render/client tests, strict Clippy,
    acceptance tests, and independent re-review through test-hardening commit
    `ba3ea3f` are green with no findings.
    **Camera-motion regression closed (2026-07-13):** exact floating-point view
    keys no longer discard a safe same-address transparent snapshot midway
    through its bounded inactive-slot upload. The staged generation now commits
    atomically before the latest pose is requested, while allocation, asset,
    tint, or stream-address changes still cancel immediately. This prevents
    newly streamed water from starving and appearing or disappearing with
    camera movement (`a4f7da5`; regression-first test, full 278-test render
    suite, strict Clippy/formatting, and diff check green). A fresh native BDS
    camera-motion capture is required below before closing live evidence.
    **Native rerun integration follow-up (2026-07-13):** the first DX12 water
    rerun exposed two independent GPU setup defects introduced by the new
    transparent-model path. The opaque packed-model pipeline now explicitly
    selects `fragment` after `model.wgsl` gained the separate
    `fragment_blend` entry point. Debug DX12 also uses the equivalent direct
    cube/model/depth-liquid draw path because wgpu 27's indirect validator
    expands a 20-byte indexed command to 32 bytes for D3D12 special constants
    while its debug batching assertion still advances by 20; release DX12 and
    unaffected backends retain multi-draw indirect. Both failures have
    regression-first coverage, the full 279-test render suite and strict
    Clippy/formatting are green, and independent review found no blocking
    issues. The corrected native run stayed alive and continuously committed
    transparent snapshots through generation 187 / 31,915 refs instead of
    panicking or starving. It still timed out at the 180-second fixture-ready
    marker while loading 7,934/9,132 debug-path subchunks, and the required
    fresh GDI capture remained pure black under the already-isolated RX 570
    Bevy/wgpu presentation failure, so this is correctness evidence rather
    than visual closure.
  - [ ] Add compact static templates in impact order: slabs/stairs,
    wall-attached vines/lichen/sculk-vein and related thin faces,
    doors/trapdoors, connection-aware panes/fences/gates, then static
    chest/sign models; retain conservative culling/connectivity for partial
    models until exact face-coverage optimization is separately verified.
    - [x] Slab asset templates: all 272 BREG1003 bottom/top/double states now
      compile through opaque six-quad packed model templates with exact
      face-specific materials, UV crops, boundary cull flags, deterministic
      deduplication, and zero pinned-pack slab diagnostics (`c64330b`; assets
      tests, strict Clippy/formatting, and independent review green).
    - [x] Slab packed rendering and occlusion: lower/upper/double slabs remain
      compact model references with six lighting sidecars and no cube stream;
      double slabs provide full-face cave/cull occlusion while partial slabs
      remain conservatively cave-open. Internal and all six cross-subchunk
      model/cube boundaries are covered without lighting reindexing
      (`6df380d`, `09279a1`; 122 asset tests, 44 render-mesh tests, strict
      Clippy/formatting, and independent review green). Gallery acceptance
      remains part of Task 14 before the parent item can close.
    - [x] Stair templates and neighbor-derived straight/inner/outer selection:
      all 512 BREG1003 states across 64 names compile through compact five-shape
      groups per material/upside signature, with exact S/W/N/E transforms,
      both Dragonfly side-isolation guards, same-half matching, all four
      horizontal cross-subchunk boundaries, selected-template lighting, and
      conservative cave connectivity (`859fb13`, `0475516`, `e1732eb`,
      `1766a56`, `469695b`). The exact pinned pack has zero stair diagnostics;
      real-pack assets/render tests, the 43-witness/five-pose deterministic
      gallery, strict MCBEAS04 integrity/tamper gates, full PowerShell dry-run
      acceptance, strict Clippy/formatting, and independent re-review are green.
    - [x] Door and trapdoor templates: all 672 door states and 336 trapdoor
      states compile through compact six-quad alpha-cutout cuboids with exact
      typed open/orientation/hinge/half selection, 3/16-block thickness,
      lower/upper door materials, conservative partial-model culling, and
      deterministic template reuse. Legacy oak-through-iron door texture arrays
      and modern bamboo/cherry/mangrove/pale-oak/nether/copper/waxed aliases are
      covered. Dragonfly's rotated door-state encoding is inverted before its
      logical-facing/open-hinge transform; an independent review caught and
      corrected the initial direct-orientation interpretation before push.
      Missing or out-of-range selectors fail closed, collision-only seeds are
      not used as render authority, and the real-pack exhaustive gate removes
      exactly 1,008 diagnostics with no additions (`1a69fca`; 145 assets tests,
      strict Clippy/formatting, full 16,913-state ratchet, and independent review
      green). Deterministic gallery/native GPU evidence remains in the shared
      residual-family live gate.
    - [x] Connected wall templates: all 5,184 states across 32 wall materials
      decode the exact 9-bit north/east/south/west none/short/tall selector and
      center-post bit into deterministic zero-to-30-quad packed models. Visible
      bounds come from the local vanilla `template_wall_post`,
      `template_wall_side`, and `template_wall_side_tall` render models rather
      than Dragonfly/Prismarine collision boxes: post-off states omit the post,
      short arms reach 14/16, tall arms reach full height, and UV projection
      follows the vanilla UV-locked blockstate contract. Invalid selectors fail
      closed, partial-model culling remains conservative, collision-seed removal
      leaves output byte-identical, and the real-pack ratchet removes exactly
      5,184 diagnostics with no additions (`09ba163`; 148 assets tests, strict
      Clippy/formatting, full 16,913-state ratchet, and independent correction
      review green). Deterministic gallery/native GPU evidence remains in the
      shared residual-family live gate.
    - [x] Pressure-plate templates and typed pressed selector: BREG1003 now
      preserves `redstone_signal` only for the 256 pressure-plate states as an
      explicit unpressed/pressed flag, without affecting redstone wire or any
      other record. All 16 material families compile through two deterministic
      opaque templates using the vanilla `pressure_plate_up/down` bounds and
      exact UV crops, including the pressed model's half-texel side strip;
      missing/invalid selectors fail closed and collision data is not render
      authority. The selector-only registry regeneration is byte-reproducible,
      changes exactly those 256 records, and the real-pack ratchet removes all
      256 pressure-plate diagnostics with no additions (`4c83afd`; registry SHA
      `fda4b40335c24b0019049ce572668b03f8ddb9a705de88abb4d724aa7ff81106`,
      152 assets tests, 23 strict-coverage tests with one real-blob gate ignored
      by default, registrygen tests/vet, strict Clippy/formatting, and independent
      correction review green). Deterministic gallery/native GPU evidence
      remains in the shared residual-family live gate.
    - [x] Fence-gate templates and bounded compound model references: all 192
      states across 12 materials require the exact typed `Orientation`, `Open`,
      and in-wall flag mask, fail closed on missing, invalid, or additional
      selectors, and compile from the vanilla render-model oracle rather than
      collision boxes. Closed/open and normal/in-wall forms preserve exact
      UV-locked geometry; bamboo uses its distinct custom 38/40-quad topology
      and reversed/rotated UV rectangles. Because exact gates exceed the
      existing 32-quad mask, one visual now selects a validated pair of
      consecutive 24+16 (bamboo closed 22+16) templates, emitted as two
      independent packed model references with contiguous lighting and draw
      records while preserving the 16-byte reference, `u32` visible mask,
      MCBEAS04 field widths, and GPU shader contract. Encoder/runtime trust
      boundaries reject empty, truncated, nested, incompatible, or directly
      referenced continuations. The production 16,913-state ratchet removes
      exactly 192 gate diagnostics with no additions and now holds 8,301
      diagnostics including air (`f4bcfe0`, `1aaf952`; full assets/render and
      visualcoverage suites, strict Clippy/formatting, real pinned-pack run, and
      independent review/re-review green). Deterministic gallery/native GPU
      evidence remains in the shared residual-family live gate.
    - [x] Connection-aware pane and fence templates plus transparent model
      streaming: all 43 pane/bar states select one of 16 exact post-and-arm
      masks, and all 13 fence states select compact post plus connection-arm
      templates while preserving wood/nether connection classes. Internal and
      all four horizontal cross-subchunk seams suppress only true pane joins;
      fences connect to full occluders, matching fences, and only the sides of
      axis-aligned gates. Mixed connected-template flags fail closed. Alpha
      admission is descriptor-scoped so stained panes retain blend materials
      without accidentally admitting full stained-glass cubes that share the
      same texture path; reviewed beacon and liquid routes remain intact.
      Alpha-blended model quads now reuse the same packed model references and
      lighting sidecars but enter a dedicated no-depth-write phase, sorted
      back-to-front by retained view and face. Sorting runs through a
      latest-wins Rayon worker cache keyed by exact CPU/GPU generation and
      stream identity; water and model uploads share one whole-subchunk,
      per-frame transparent-reference budget. The production 16,913-state
      ratchet removes exactly 56 diagnostics with zero additions and leaves
      8,066 diagnostics including air (`a2c3a5a`, `5024f21`; full assets/render
      suites, strict Clippy/formatting, pinned-pack ratchet, and independent
      review/re-review green). Deterministic gallery/native GPU evidence
      remains in the shared residual-family live gate.
    - [x] Carpet and stateful pale-moss-carpet templates: all 17 ordinary
      stateless carpets compile as exact opaque 1/16-block cuboids with the
      pinned wool/moss aliases, while all 162 pale-moss states enforce the
      exact four `none`/`short`/`tall` side properties and upper-bit contract.
      Pale bases stay opaque; side planes use the pinned two-entry cutout pair
      in its verified tall/short order, render two-sided with conservative
      connectivity, preserve the isolated-upper base-plus-four-tall special
      case, and quantize vanilla's unrepresentable 1.6/256 inset symmetrically
      to 2/254. Missing, invalid, extra, or mismatched typed selectors fail
      closed; collision seeds do not affect rendering. The production ratchet
      removes exactly 179 carpet diagnostics with no additions and now holds
      8,122 diagnostics including air (`8087b6a`, `9323093`, `9e99a5e`; exact
      opposing and direction-specific Java UV corner orders, two byte-identical
      pinned builds, full assets/visualcoverage suites, renderer regressions,
      strict workspace Clippy/formatting, and independent final re-review green).
      Deterministic gallery/native GPU evidence remains in the shared
      residual-family live gate.
    - [x] Button templates and exact wall UV locking: all 168 states across 14
      materials enforce the exact `Orientation` plus pressed-flag mask and
      canonical schema, fail closed on missing/extra/invalid selectors, and map
      Bedrock's six outward-facing values to deterministic floor, ceiling, and
      four wall transforms. Unpressed and pressed forms use the exact vanilla
      bounds and face rectangles, with the unrepresentable 1.02-pixel pressed
      depth deliberately quantized to one pixel. Wall faces derive UV-locked
      rectangles from rotated target bounds; independent literal six-face
      goldens cover all four directions and both pressed states after review
      caught and corrected the initial source-space projection. Materials stay
      opaque, partial models advertise no boundary culling/coverage, and
      collision seeds are not render authority. The production ratchet removes
      exactly 168 button diagnostics with no additions and now holds 7,898
      diagnostics including air after integrating the already-landed 56-state
      pane/fence tranche (`8b427eb`, `fe55779`; deterministic pinned
      builds, full assets/render/visualcoverage suites, strict Clippy/formatting,
      and independent final re-review green). Deterministic gallery/native GPU
      evidence remains in the shared residual-family live gate.
    - [x] Canonical huge-mushroom cube states: all 48 states across brown
      mushroom blocks, red mushroom blocks, and mushroom stems now select the
      pinned pack's exact six-face material aliases from the canonical tagged
      `huge_mushroom_bits` integer. Missing, extra, untagged, mistyped,
      noncanonical, or out-of-range selectors fail closed. The focused
      production-pack gate preserves diagnostics for all 43 legacy flags-zero
      cube records, all 25 stained-glass/copper-grate/slime transparency-family
      cubes, and `minecraft:invisible_bedrock`; record reordering remains
      byte-deterministic. The production ratchet removes exactly 48 intended
      diagnostics with zero additions. After integrating the already-landed
      128-state glow-lichen/sculk-vein tranche, that historical checkpoint held
      7,722 diagnostics including air (full assets/visualcoverage suites, pinned
      compiler tests, strict Clippy/formatting, and zero-delta refreshed ratchet
      green).
    - [x] Ordinary stained-glass cubes: the exact stateless
      `minecraft:black_stained_glass`, `minecraft:blue_stained_glass`,
      `minecraft:brown_stained_glass`, `minecraft:cyan_stained_glass`,
      `minecraft:gray_stained_glass`, `minecraft:green_stained_glass`,
      `minecraft:light_blue_stained_glass`,
      `minecraft:light_gray_stained_glass`, `minecraft:lime_stained_glass`,
      `minecraft:magenta_stained_glass`, `minecraft:orange_stained_glass`,
      `minecraft:pink_stained_glass`, `minecraft:purple_stained_glass`,
      `minecraft:red_stained_glass`, `minecraft:white_stained_glass`, and
      `minecraft:yellow_stained_glass` records now render as alpha-blended
      six-quad models. Palette-native meshing suppresses a shared face only for
      an equal six-face material identity under the checked transparent-cube
      semantic, preserves both cross-colour boundary faces, culls glass behind
      full opaque neighbours without hiding the opaque face, stays cave-open,
      and applies across all six subchunk boundaries. Education `hard_*` glass,
      stained-glass panes, copper grates, slime, legacy flags-zero cubes, and
      `minecraft:invisible_bedrock` remain excluded. The production ratchet
      removes exactly these 16 IDs with zero additions, leaving 7,706
      diagnostics and 7,235 cumulative removals; the ignored integrated blob is
      SHA-256
      `61025bb3e8e1b9ca0d5e2ec1cd7847433333a20f99948c6193fbb370a0d4900f`.
    - [x] Copper grates: the exact stateless `minecraft:copper_grate`,
      `minecraft:exposed_copper_grate`, `minecraft:weathered_copper_grate`,
      `minecraft:oxidized_copper_grate`, `minecraft:waxed_copper_grate`,
      `minecraft:waxed_exposed_copper_grate`,
      `minecraft:waxed_weathered_copper_grate`, and
      `minecraft:waxed_oxidized_copper_grate` records now use homogeneous
      alpha-cutout six-quad transparent-cube templates. Waxed variants retain
      the exact unwaxed face-material aliases, while shared-face culling uses
      exact network identity so wax and oxidation boundaries remain visible in
      sequential and hashed modes. Grates stay cave-open, route only through
      ordinary depth-writing model draws, cull against identical states across
      all six subchunk boundaries, and preserve opaque-neighbour asymmetry.
      Slime, stained/hard glass, panes, copper bars/bulbs/doors/trapdoors,
      unrelated grate names, legacy flags-zero records, and
      `minecraft:invisible_bedrock` remain outside this admission. The
      production ratchet removes exactly eight IDs with zero additions, leaving
      7,698 diagnostics and 7,243 cumulative removals; the ignored integrated
      blob SHA-256 is
      `20cd1b4301f40736468a3249acf21fdea0544d74fa238d8faae04aaee1af9940`.
    - [x] Chiseled bookshelves: all 256 canonical
      `minecraft:chiseled_bookshelf` states (sequential IDs 1,605–1,860) now
      compile from the exact `books_stored:int 0..63 × direction:int 0..3`
      product into 64 immutable north-facing templates and four opaque source
      materials. Each template has five ordinary full faces plus six coplanar
      front-slot quads; native 1.26.33.1 evidence fixes bit order to top-left,
      top-middle, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right and fixes
      directions 0/1/2/3 to south/west/north/east. Exact pair/static terrain
      access, unit collision, flags, face coverage, typed state, ID formula,
      and complete-family cardinality all fail closed. Ordinary and six-quad
      front faces cull across every subchunk boundary, the full model closes
      cave connectivity, and the dense-subchunk fixture emits exactly 1,352
      model refs and 2,816 visible quad refs with stable 11-record lighting
      spans. The exact production ratchet removes only IDs 1,605–1,860 with
      zero additions, leaving 2,570 diagnostics including air. Registry SHA-256
      is `3e0a67718b6368d8b5f7755e9e49a1241233f21bcea8724a9163febb4f1b1d92`;

      - [ ] Live presentation acceptance: capture Cinnabar from the matching
        native-gallery viewpoints and require two consecutive exact
        GPU-completed model-stream witnesses. Keep both native and Cinnabar
        screenshots local-only; do not commit Mojang-derived imagery.
    - [x] Resin clumps: all 64 canonical `minecraft:resin_clump` states
      (sequential IDs 2,930–2,993) now require the exact typed
      `multi_face_direction_bits:int 0..63` product, formula IDs, empty flags and
      face coverage, empty collision, and the exact scalar/static
      `resin_clump` texture route. Native 1.26.33.1 support-removal/readback
      fixes bits 1/2/4/8/16/32 to down/up/south/west/north/east, matches the
      glow-lichen UV projection, and proves that a written zero mask reloads as
      63. The compiler preserves every protocol record while aliasing mask 0 to
      mask 63, emitting one static alpha-cutout material, 63 templates, and 192
      quads. Sequential and hashed mesh gates cover every mask, all six
      boundaries, cave openness, opaque-support visibility, layered water, and
      the dense 4,096-reference/24,576-draw-light bound. The exact production
      ratchet removes only IDs 2,930–2,993 with zero additions, leaving 2,506
      diagnostics including air. Registry SHA-256 is
      `33a31ec89a04fe638a4f59ab315561c1c0d897e04f2041d5643262d3de56d30c`;

      - [ ] Live presentation acceptance: reproduce the native resin viewpoints
        in Cinnabar and require two consecutive exact GPU-completed model-stream
        witnesses. Native and Cinnabar screenshots remain local-only.
    - [x] Reviewed selector-alias opaque cubes: validate all 38 records in the
      complete hay, bone, quartz-block, smooth-quartz, chiseled-quartz, purpur,
      and TNT products, then promote exactly 27 compatibility states. Exact
      typed wrappers, raw keys, values, formula IDs, Primary/Cube facts, shape 1
      CollisionOnly unit bounds, complete-product cardinality, and exact
      static/non-tinted/opaque vanilla pack descriptors fail closed. Native
      1.26.33.1 evidence preserves Y caps down/up, X caps west/east, Z caps
      north/south, and a quarter-turn on all four non-cap faces for X/Z;
      `deprecated=0..3` and `explode_bit=0..1` are static visual aliases.
      Sequential/hash rendering covers every state, all six cross-subchunk
      culls, dense six-quad greedy output, cave closure, and zero model,
      transparent, and liquid streams. The exact production ratchet removes
      only IDs 2,908-2,910, 2,912-2,914, 2,916-2,918, 5,443-5,444,
      6,466-6,468, 6,470-6,472, 6,474-6,476, 7,082-7,083, 13,113,

      - [ ] Live presentation acceptance: reproduce the matching native axis,
        TNT, and deprecated-state viewpoints and require two consecutive exact
        GPU-completed cube-stream witnesses. Screenshots remain local-only.
    - [x] Exact cactus family implementation: all 16 canonical
      `minecraft:cactus` states (sequential IDs 13,606-13,621) now require the
      complete exact `age:int 0..15` product, formula IDs, Primary/Cuboid
      ownership, empty flags and face coverage, exact shape-84 collision, and
      exact static side/down/up pack routes. Native 1.26.33.1 evidence fixes the
      visible X/Z inset to 1/16, full Y height, and side UV crop to source
      columns 1..14. Every age reuses one six-quad template and three static
      alpha-cutout materials. Sequential/hash, all-boundary, opaque-adjacency,
      cave-open, additional-water, dense 4,096-reference/24,576-draw-light,
      deterministic-registry, deterministic-pack, and exact 2,479 -> 2,463
      visual-coverage gates are green. No Mojang payload or screenshot is
      tracked.
      - [ ] Live presentation acceptance: reproduce the matching native cactus
        overview, stack, grazing, and top-inset viewpoints in Cinnabar and
        require two consecutive exact GPU-completed model-stream witnesses with
        stable generation/ref counts and zero contamination counters.
    - [x] Exact cake family implementation: all seven canonical
      `minecraft:cake` states (sequential IDs 14,055-14,061) now require the
      complete exact `bite_counter:int 0..6` product, formula IDs,
      Primary/Cuboid ownership, empty flags/coverage, exact collision shapes
      89-95, exact six-face block routing, and literal untinted terrain pairs.
      Native 1.26.33.1 evidence fixes west as the advancing cut plane and binds
      bite zero to `cake_side` versus bites one through six to `cake_inner`.
      Seven immutable six-quad templates use
      `[16+32*b,0,16]..[240,128,240]`; sequential/hash, all-boundary,
      opaque-adjacency, cave-open, additional-water, dense
      4,096-reference/24,576-draw-light, deterministic-registry,
      deterministic-pack, and exact 2,463 -> 2,456 visual-coverage gates are
      green. No Mojang payload or screenshot is tracked.
      - [ ] Live presentation acceptance: reproduce representative bite 0, 1,
        and 6 native viewpoints in Cinnabar and require two consecutive exact
        GPU-completed model-stream witnesses with stable generation/ref counts
        and zero contamination counters.
    - [x] Exact farmland family implementation: all eight canonical
      `minecraft:farmland` states (sequential IDs 6,122-6,129) now require the
      complete exact `moisturized_amount:int 0..7` product, formula IDs,
      Primary/Cuboid ownership, empty flags/coverage, exact shape-43 collision,
      and literal untinted side/top routes. Native 1.26.33.1 evidence binds
      amount zero to dry terrain-array index 1 and amounts one through seven to
      wet index 0. Two immutable six-quad templates use full X/Z and 15/16 Y;
      sequential/hash, all-boundary, opaque-adjacency, cave-open,
      additional-water, uniform/mixed dense 4,096-reference/24,576-draw-light,
      deterministic-registry, deterministic-pack, and exact 2,456 -> 2,448
      visual-coverage gates are green. No Mojang payload or screenshot is
      tracked.
      - [ ] Live presentation acceptance: reproduce representative moisture 0,
        1, and 7 native viewpoints in Cinnabar and require two consecutive
        exact GPU-completed model-stream witnesses with stable generation/ref
        counts and zero contamination counters.
    - [ ] Slab/stair native and packed-GPU live acceptance: capture all five
      fixed Cinnabar poses through native `%TEMP%` screenshots and require two
      consecutive exact GPU-completed model-stream witnesses. Automated gallery
      construction is complete. The Top pose now reaches two consecutive exact
      7-key GPU witnesses with 276 model references and zero missing, stale,
      wrong-stream, zero-reference, or draw-mismatch counters after moving the
      camera teleport ahead of the synthetic fixture-update flood. The five
      inspectable native captures and a clean performance-gate run remain open;
      the first repaired live run was rejected at 138.3439 ms mutation-to-visible
      against the 100 ms gate. Audit found that the already-complete exact model
      witness remained armed throughout the later timed session, rebuilding a
      full frame probe over thousands of instances every frame. The probe now
      disarms immediately after its exact two-frame pair, and gallery publication
      now waits for an exact Rust-side committed-camera marker before sending the
      fixture-update flood. Unit, full-workspace, acceptance dry-run, and runtime
      safety regressions are green; a fresh native five-pose rerun remains open.
      North run `20260714T011758Z-840` then passed its exact camera fence,
      77-command result fence, and consecutive GPU model witnesses (sequences
      907/908, seven keys, 277 refs, all contamination counters zero), but the
      timed gate still failed at p50 41.7 ms / p99 47.6 ms and 140.1161 ms
      mutation-to-visible. Its 55-second camera delay was a bounded Rust ingress
      bottleneck (four queued packets and eight admissions per rendered frame),
      not relay reordering; the channel and per-frame admission window are now
      coherently 32, matching the existing heavy-event cap while preserving FIFO
      order and decode/mesh worker budgets. GPU cost and fresh native visual
      evidence remain open. The first GPU-side correction now rejects all padded
      and neighbour-masked slots in the model vertex stage before template,
      lighting, texture, tint, and fragment work; the fixed 32-quad/reference
      storage contract remains bounded while a live A/B measures the reduction.
      Optimized North run `20260714T013915Z-6480` reduced teleport
      acknowledgement-to-ingress/commit to 8.18 seconds (sequence 2,128, with
      ingress and commit in the same update) and again passed the exact model
      witness. Vertex culling improved p50 from 41.7 to 39.6 ms despite 8,699
      versus 5,679 resident subchunks, but p99 remained 47.7 ms and the 100 ms
      mutation gate still failed at 139.9718 ms. Structural exact-count model
      drawing is now complete in `fcb1989` and ownership-hardening `b07e194`:
      one exact eight-byte visible-quad indirection record replaces the fixed
      32-quad vertex launch while preserving 16-byte model refs, ordered
      lighting, one direct/MDI command per subchunk, arena/COW bounds, and model
      witness semantics. Full render/client tests, strict Clippy/format/shader
      validation, release build, and independent review/re-review are green.
      Live VineGallery run `20260714T030538Z-22388` passed exact GPU witnesses
      at sequences 191/192 (four keys, 95 stable refs, all contamination
      counters zero) but measured p50 40.6 ms, p99 47.7 ms, and 142.6 ms
      mutation-to-visible with 8,345 resident subchunks—neutral versus the prior
      p50 40.3 / p99 47.8 / 138.9454 ms run. Exact drawing therefore closes the
      required packed per-quad architecture but not the performance gate; GPU
      stage timestamps/workload counters must identify the remaining cost before
      considering a one-sided/two-sided pipeline split. Resident and
      frustum-visible model workload counters are now implemented: acceptance
      JSON distinguishes 16-byte model refs from exact eight-byte quad draw refs
      and reports the former fixed 32-quad slot invocations avoided. Full
      render/client suites are green. Acceptance/profiling runs now also enable
      Bevy's asynchronous DX12 timestamp recorder and report paired, deduplicated
      p50/p95/p99/max timings for the chunk-containing opaque and transparent 3D
      passes without blocking the GPU. Live VineGallery North run
      `20260714T032404Z-12360` recorded 1,296 GPU samples: combined opaque plus
      transparent was 4.9 ms p50 / 10.2 ms p99 (10.54048 ms max), while full
      frame time remained 40.2 ms p50 / 47.6 ms p99. Its 29,083 visible model
      refs issued 80,233 exact quad draws and avoided 850,423 of the former
      930,656 fixed-slot invocations (91.38%); resident totals were 63,327 refs,
      161,125 draws, and 1,865,339 avoided invocations. The exact-draw path is
      therefore effective and model shader work is not the remaining frame-time
      bottleneck; do not add a speculative one/two-sided model pipeline split.
      The run again passed adjacent exact GPU witnesses (sequences 801/802,
      four keys, 92 refs, zero contamination), stayed within the RSS/CPU budget
      at 638,537,728 bytes and 2.82% mean CPU, and failed only the shared 100 ms
      mutation gate at 142.5286 ms. The next performance investigation must
      target frame scheduling/presentation and mutation-to-frame latency.
      Two process-scoped pacing A/Bs on the same approved DX12 runtime ruled
      out unsafe workarounds: AutoNoVsync run `20260714T033621Z-14584` never
      reached the world-ready/mutation fence, while FIFO with
      `WGPU_DX12_USE_FRAME_LATENCY_WAITABLE_OBJECT=dontwait` in run
      `20260714T034035Z-22400` reached the clean gallery/camera fence but never
      produced a GPU-completed model witness and resisted graceful shutdown.
      Keep wgpu's default waitable-object behavior for correctness; surface
      acquisition/presentation remains the evidence-backed external blocker.
      The backend/presentation investigation is now
      conclusive: five direct swapchain captures from Cinnabar, minimal Bevy
      Camera3d and Camera2d clear-only probes, a camera-local red clear, and
      DX12/FXC were byte-identical pure black. Vulkan exposes no surface present
      modes and GL exposes no adapter on this machine. This isolates the native
      black-window symptom below Cinnabar to Bevy 0.18.1/wgpu DX12 on the RX 570
      driver `31.0.21924.61`; chunk, camera, shader, and custom render-phase code
      must not be changed to mask it. A driver or isolated Bevy/wgpu A/B plus a
      tiny startup clear-color smoke gate remains required before native visual
      evidence can close, while deterministic GPU witnesses can continue.
      **Visibility investigation checkpoint (2026-07-15; telemetry only):**
      acceptance/metrics runs now publish one coherent, fixed-size diagnostic
      snapshot for each rendered frame. It fingerprints the extracted camera
      identity, pose, and frustum with monotonic pose/view generations; records
      resident-mesh, cave-visible, Bevy-frustum-visible opaque, and actually
      submitted opaque Direct/MDI key counts plus deterministic hashes; and
      reports the three adjacent stage-loss count/hash deltas. Collection is
      disabled outside the existing acceptance/metrics diagnostics path, emits
      at most one aggregate marker per second, retains no per-key history, and
      caps the transient submitted-key set at 65,536 entries; overflow marks
      the submitted digest and its adjacent loss unavailable instead of
      publishing a truncated prefix as exact. Deterministic/empty/mutation,
      generation-coherence, Direct/MDI-parity, and bound tests are present. This
      checkpoint changes no culling, meshing, shader, draw-order, or presentation
      behavior and does not establish a visibility fix. A fresh affected live
      run must still capture consecutive `RUST_MCBE_VISIBILITY_SNAPSHOT`
      markers spanning the symptom and identify the first nonzero adjacent loss
      before any repair is proposed.
      **Live diagnostic-geometry attribution (2026-07-16):** every actually
      emitted diagnostic cube quad now carries its exact raw network identity
      and resolved protocol-1001 sequential identity through bounded meshing,
      resident replacement/eviction, JSON, `WORLD_READY`, and revision-gated
      live telemetry. Per-mesh/global top sets are deterministic and bounded;
      omitted contributions remain exactly reversible under capacity churn;
      identical remeshes do not resort or relog unchanged data. Independent
      review and post-merge meshing/app/assets tests are green through
      `eda5ba9`. A native BDS run then proved the dominant visible magenta
      geometry is `minecraft:sulfur` (14658/`0x2d658dd8`) and
      `minecraft:cinnabar` (12638/`0xbda02665`), with `minecraft:leaf_litter`
      far behind, replacing screenshot-based family guesses with exact live
      evidence.
      **Sulfur/cinnabar exact route complete (2026-07-16):** both single-state
      minerals now compile as exact opaque full cubes for sequential and hashed
      protocol identities. Admission proves the reviewed collision, selector,
      sound, static texture, tint, flipbook, alias, and extension-metadata
      boundaries and rejects the pair atomically on any mismatch. Independent
      review, the ignored pinned-pack witness, full affected suites, and strict
      checks are green through the `6aeb8c8` merge. Production visual diagnostics
      fell exactly from 2,400 to 2,398 with zero additions. **Native gate passed
      on `3bdb317`:** fresh ignored carriers joined BDS and both minerals were
      absent from the day and forced-night diagnostic top sets, replacing their
      former ~328k/~322k quad dominance with leaf-litter states at roughly 2.5k
      quads each. A residual magenta rectangle and remaining 2,398 compile-time
      diagnostics keep the broader zero-magenta Phase 2.6 gate open.
      **Fixed-pose diagnostic attempt (2026-07-15):** run
      `20260715T164233Z-14908` disabled auto-fly and retained one stable render
      view generation, but the client never emitted its mutation/world-ready
      marker, so the harness timed out before publishing and facing the requested
      `Front` fixture. The resulting 62 stable-pose snapshots therefore do not
      constitute the required aimed-camera reproduction. They still narrow the
      pipeline: 61/62 had exact frustum-visible/submitted counts and hashes; the
      sole mismatch was the final snapshot taken as the failed harness entered
      cleanup. No culling repair is authorized by this evidence. The next probe
      must establish a fixture-facing camera independently of the world-ready
      marker and reproduce the user's visible disappearance before changing
      cave, frustum, or submission behavior.
    - [ ] Wall-attached vine family: replace the diagnostic pink-cube fallback
      for every `minecraft:vine` direction-bit state with compact cutout face
      templates selected from its exact attachment mask, including conservative
      cave connectivity, cross-subchunk neighbours, texture/UV parity, and a
      deterministic gallery plus native screenshot/GPU evidence. Extend the
      same reviewed thin-face route to glow lichen and sculk vein separately;
      do not collapse their distinct state/property contracts into vine logic.
      **Implementation complete; live gate open (2026-07-13):** all 16 masks
      compile to foliage-tinted two-sided attachment planes with exact UV axes,
      zero diagnostics, zero-mask no-draw behavior, and all-mask/all-boundary
      CPU mesh coverage (`ff7066b`; focused Go/assets/render tests and two
      independent reviews green). Deterministic acceptance is now complete in
      `489af26` and `748438c`: five canonical poses bind the exact 0..15 mask
      bijection and compiled-asset hashes, build isolated direction-exact stone
      supports, preserve mask 0 as zero-draw, fence the committed camera ahead
      of publication, and require two adjacent GPU-completed markers over the
      exact requested subchunks with stable generation, manifest, nonzero model
      reference total, and zero missing/stale/wrong-stream/zero-ref/draw-mismatch
      counters. Live evidence proved the total is subchunk-wide rather than one
      reference per central fixture (94 refs in run `20260714T023010Z-7488`), so
      the invalid interim 15/43 equality was removed in `eec96e2`; review then
      withdrew that recommendation and passed the corrected contract. The run
      produced adjacent exact witnesses at sequences 461/462, four keys, 94
      stable refs, and all contamination counters zero. Its only failure was the
      shared model-performance gate: 138.9454 ms mutation-to-visible against
      100 ms, p50 40.3 ms, p99 47.8 ms, with 8,595 resident subchunks. Combined
      RSS peaked at 532,107,264 bytes and mean CPU was 2.52%, within resource
      budgets. Native captures and the structural exact-count model-draw
      optimization remain required before this item closes; native capture is
      separately blocked by the confirmed RX 570 Bevy/wgpu presentation failure
      above. Exact visible-quad drawing is complete but was performance-neutral;
      GPU-stage measurement and the shared 100 ms gate remain open.
      **Glow-lichen/sculk-vein implementation complete (2026-07-13):** the
      remaining vine-like pink blocks were not `minecraft:vine`; they were all
      64 `minecraft:glow_lichen` and 64 `minecraft:sculk_vein` states still
      classified as unknown. Distinct registry families now preserve their
      different six-bit face orders, render mask zero with the vanilla all-six
      fallback, and compile exact 1/256-inset two-sided cutout planes with no
      occlusion coverage. Sculk vein additionally binds its pinned four-frame,
      20-tick flipbook. Exhaustive 128-state selector/geometry/UV/material
      tests, the real pinned-pack compiler, registrygen, runtime rendering,
      strict visual-coverage ratchet, Clippy, formatting, and independent
      review are green; the combined 16,913-state report has zero
      glow-lichen/sculk-vein diagnostics and 7,770 diagnostics remaining
      overall (`a70d3c6`). Native screenshot closure remains part of the shared
      RX 570 presentation gate above.
    - [x] Exhaustive vanilla visual-coverage ratchet: inventory every one of
      the 16,913 protocol-1001 canonical states through the production registry
      and runtime decoders, bind the exact registry/asset hashes, and reject any
      newly diagnostic, newly provisional-fallback, or unjustifiably invisible
      state. Diagnostic/fallback shrinkage is allowed while residual families are
      implemented; the final gate requires zero diagnostic and zero provisional
      fallback non-air states. The accepted design is recorded in
      `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-exhaustive-vanilla-coverage-design.md`.
      **Complete (2026-07-13):** `visualcoverage` uses the production decoders,
      enforces the exact 1,356-name/16,913-state/one-air protocol corpus and
      exact hash-to-sequential bijection, bounds all inputs, rejects diagnostic
      regression/invisible laundering, and writes deterministic hash-bound
      reports (`b131247`; 11 tests, strict Clippy, real-pack run, and independent
      review green). The reviewed baseline was refreshed cumulatively for the
      already-landed door, trapdoor, wall, pressure-plate, fence-gate, pane,
      fence, carpet, button, huge-mushroom, glow-lichen, sculk-vein, exact
      ordinary stained-glass, exact copper-grate, static-sign,
      chiseled-bookshelf, resin-clump, selector-alias opaque-cube, and exact
      cactus tranches.
      After lava, vine, and those connected/static/multiface/glass/grate
      families plus the exact chiseled-bookshelf, resin-clump, selector-alias
      opaque-cube, cactus, cake, farmland, and exact bee-housing tranches, the
      reviewed baseline held 2,398 diagnostics including one air state.
      **Provisional zero-pink cutover (2026-08-02; incomplete):** the compiler
      now maps the exact 2,397 non-air baseline identities to bounded neutral
      geometry and pinned-pack textures where safely resolvable, otherwise
      canonical stone. The identity table is bound to each network hash plus a
      canonical-state fingerprint, so unknown/custom server blocks remain
      diagnostic. `VisualSupport` preserves this distinction through MCBEAS06
      and runtime decode; visualcoverage v2 reports zero diagnostics and 2,397
      provisional fallbacks across 487 names instead of laundering them as exact.
      The source inventory and hashes are pinned in
      `assets/vanilla-fallback-source-v1001.json`. This removes pink vanilla
      blocks but closes no vanilla parity acceptance gate.
  - [ ] Complete the exhaustive residual-family report, continuing from the
    completed lava/flowing-lava depth-writing non-water-liquid pipeline, so
    every non-air one of the 16,913 canonical states has an exact or otherwise
    authoritative accepted visual; provisional fallbacks do not satisfy this
    requirement. Close deterministic galleries and live acceptance with
    globally zero diagnostic and zero provisional-fallback counters,
    vanilla-reference screenshots, upload/memory/CPU
    metrics, and teleport-remesh evidence.
    - [x] Lava implementation: all 32 `minecraft:lava` and
      `minecraft:flowing_lava` depth states compile through the animated liquid
      mesher without water tint or alpha blending, use an immutable packed route
      bit, retain the O(n) transparent-water/depth-lava partition, and draw in a
      separate opaque depth-writing direct/MDI pipeline. Mixed interfaces and all
      six cross-subchunk boundaries are covered. Full assets/render suites,
      strict Clippy/formatting, the real 16,913-state ratchet, and independent
      review are green; deterministic native gallery/GPU/performance evidence
      remains part of the residual-family live gate.
    - [x] Exact bee nest/beehive cubes: all 48 canonical states across
      `minecraft:bee_nest` and `minecraft:beehive` now preserve the typed
      direction 0..3 by honey-level 0..5 product, full-cube collision and
      occlusion, and the compact packed cube stream. Protocol direction maps
      the front south/west/north/east; only honey level 5 selects the honeyed
      front. The compiler requires the pinned six-face block maps, singleton
      static terrain arrays, exact two-entry front arrays, literal paths, and
      no tint/extra/flipbook metadata. Both network-ID modes, all states, dense
      greedy closure, and all six cross-subchunk boundaries are covered. The
      full real-pack ratchet removes exactly IDs 10,395..10,418 and
      12,495..12,518 with zero additions, shrinking 2,448 -> 2,400 diagnostics.
      Bee occupants remain a separately reviewed block-entity concern rather
      than block-state geometry.
    - [ ] Shelf visual authority: the exact twelve-name/384-state registry
      contract is classified and now fails closed if one complete family is
      missing or an unexpected `_shelf` family appears. The installed Bedrock
      1.26.3301.0 package exposes direction-specific
      `minecraft:voxel_shape` files and the installed/pinned vanilla packs
      expose shelf texture routes, texture sets, and pixels, but none defines
      visible render geometry or per-face UV mapping. Collision/voxel bounds
      must not be promoted into an exact render model. All 384 shelf states use
      the explicitly provisional non-magenta fallback and remain open visual
      parity work. Resume shelf work only
      from legitimate version-matched render/UV authority or a reviewed native
      procedure; precise paths and hashes are recorded in
      `docs/evidence/phase-2-shelf-source-reference.md`.
    - [ ] Close static sign visual parity and its deterministic native gallery.
      - [x] Eliminate all 4,872 standing, wall, and hanging-sign diagnostics
        with typed, order-independent selectors; exact 16-way rotation, six-way
        facing, attachment, and hanging matrices; pinned terrain aliases; and
        bounded static model templates. All-six-facing tests caught and fixed
        reversed wall/wall-hanging support placement. The classic raw 24x12
        board plus 2/3 render transform establishes the 16x8 world silhouette,
        and sign text remains a block-entity deferral (`5987ed6`, `fba9e2e`).
      - [ ] Source-adjudicate exact board thickness, standing-post dimensions,
        and hanging board/support cuboids, then close UV/native-reference and
        GPU evidence. The pinned Bedrock sample pack exposes sign terrain aliases
        but no authoritative sign geometry, so the current shapes must not be
        described as final 1:1 geometry until this evidence is recorded.
    - [ ] Run all 67 exact-state GPU gallery pages (256 targets per logical page,
      with one final 17-state page), require exact palette readback plus two
      consecutive GPU-completed frames for every canonical target, and inspect
      fresh native `%TEMP%` screenshots. Family-specific support/neighbour
      fixtures do not count toward the 16,913 target inventory. The reviewed
      implementation order starts with a deterministic BREG/MCBEAS/hash-bound
      logical page inventory, then adds exact app-side palette witnesses,
      per-target GPU evidence, family-aware placement, and native captures; the
      logical inventory is independent of the RX 570 presentation blocker.
      - [x] Compile the exact logical target inventory: all 16,913 sequential
        IDs are assigned once and in order to 66 full 256-target pages plus a
        final 17-target page. The deterministic artifact binds BREG, MCBEAS, and
        coverage-baseline hashes, retains per-target diagnostic/drawable/
        invisible status, and is deliberately non-accepting until both the
        diagnostic count reaches zero and the strict semantic render-route gate
        passes. The CLI writes atomically and preserves an existing output on
        failure (`500c4af`, `59f692c`; full tests, pinned real-pack check,
        strict Clippy/formatting, and independent re-review green).
    - [ ] Generate a separate version-pinned block-entity inventory and reviewed
      renderer manifest. Prove chunk-NBT and live-update handling, required NBT
      variants, and GPU/no-draw evidence for every source ID; block entities are
      not folded into the canonical block-state count. The ingestion audit found
      21 explicit Dragonfly source IDs plus an id-less Note producer that must be
      explicitly adjudicated. Packet-56 and chunk/subchunk-tail NBT now reaches
      the bounded sparse world store; per-ID renderer evidence remains open. The
      bounded implementation order is
      NetworkLittleEndian NBT prefix decoding plus atomic sparse storage first,
      then a separate deterministic source/renderer-manifest generator and
      strict join, followed by per-ID GPU/no-draw witnesses.
      - [x] Implement bounded NetworkLittleEndian NBT prefix decoding and
        atomic sparse ingestion for inline and request-mode LevelChunk tails,
        successful SubChunk tails, and packet-56 live updates. Exact NBT bytes,
        optional source IDs, and absolute positions remain sparse and
        palette-native; strict byte/depth/collection/entity limits, scope and
        duplicate checks, vanilla dimension Y validation, per-chunk cumulative
        record/raw-byte caps across tail and live updates, FIFO worker decoding,
        malformed-update retention, all-air cleanup, and chunk eviction are
        covered without flat block expansion. The separate deterministic
        inventory/renderer manifest is now generated below; per-ID renderer
        and GPU/no-draw witnesses remain open.
      - [x] Generate and commit the independent protocol-1001 block-entity
        inventory plus reviewed renderer manifest from the exact Dragonfly
        `b85c56ffea6b306798a935f14cc941c76618be52` registration pin and the
        hash-bound BDS 1.26.32.2 runtime evidence. The isolated generator
        rejects workspace dependency drift, generic `unknownBlock` NBT
        passthrough, source/hash drift, missing/extra/duplicate source keys,
        ambiguous aliases, and missing chunk/live-update/variant declarations.
        Its deterministic artifact covers all 21 explicit Dragonfly NBT IDs
        plus the id-less `Note` producer, 63 backing block names, 446 canonical
        backing states, and 42 required NBT variants without changing the
        16,913 block-state count. The strict-final report truthfully remains
        red at 0 proven/22 deferred: renderer implementations, gallery builders,
        per-variant witnesses, and per-ID GPU or no-draw evidence remain open.
      - [x] Add the hash-bound runtime adjudication and lifecycle foundation for
        the reviewed block-entity catalog. Barrel, BlastFurnace, Furnace, and
        Smoker reuse their exact existing cube state; Jukebox and the exact
        id-less Note candidate route to logical no-additional-draw outcomes;
        every reviewed deferred ID requires its exact canonical backing; all
        mismatched/unknown sequential or hashed states fail closed with
        non-conflating route digests. Inline LevelChunk, request-mode
        LevelChunk, and packet-56 NBT-only replacements preserve block, light,
        mesh, connectivity, and render generations when backing/biomes are
        unchanged, while changed backing/biomes, eviction, dimension reset,
        and session reset retain destructive lifecycle behavior. Full affected
        Rust/Go suites, strict Clippy/formatting, and independent re-review are
        green through `558de41`. This is logical routing evidence only: the
        strict-final artifact remains 0 proven/22 deferred until the required
        per-variant GPU/no-draw witnesses below are generated and joined.
      - [ ] Implement the reviewed per-ID renderer routes and gallery builders,
        then close every required NBT-variant witness and GPU/no-draw witness so
        the block-entity strict-final gate reaches 22 proven with no deferrals.
    - [ ] Merge both the Axolotl protocol-fix branch and Cinnabar feature branch
      into their respective `main` branches through reviewed PRs using normal
      history-preserving merge commits (never squash or rebase the feature
      history), only after the applicable deterministic tests, native/GPU
      acceptance, zero-diagnostic state gate, and block-entity manifest gate
      are green.
- [ ] **2.7 Client lighting and atmosphere.** `P2.7-ATMOSPHERE` Block/sky flood fill, baked vertex
  light and day/night, then sky, fog, and clouds; finish the Phase 2 parity and
  teleport-remesh acceptance gates.
  - [x] Normalize SetTime and rain/thunder level events into bounded,
    vendor-independent protocol events; retain StartGame's initial current
    tick, day-cycle lock time, case-insensitive boolean `doDaylightCycle`
    state (default enabled when absent), and clamped initial rain/lightning.
    Runtime `GameRulesChanged` packets normalize only a case-insensitive
    boolean `doDaylightCycle` entry and ignore wrong types. Two deferred
    pre-spawn SetTime
    packets retain FIFO order in Play, post-spawn normalization is identical,
    and non-finite initial weather values fail closed.
  - [x] Consume the normalized environment stream into app-owned clock and
    weather resources without interpreting visual curves. A replacement
    StartGame begins a new environment session, anchors its exact initial tick,
    preserves its cycle lock and bounded rain/lightning targets, advances only
    while `doDaylightCycle` is enabled, and uses the lock tick only when the
    rule is explicitly disabled. A runtime false transition freezes the exact
    current visual tick; true re-anchors and resumes it. Exact signed SetTime
    values immediately re-anchor either a running or frozen clock. Dimension
    changes
    preserve that world-session snapshot. FIFO-committed SetTime/day-cycle/weather
    updates do not dirty meshes, enqueue mesh changes, or change cave
    connectivity. Mesh-baked light response and vanilla atmosphere parity
    remain open.
  - [x] Implement the renderer-independent sparse light core: independent
    uniform-or-packed block/sky nibble volumes, copy-on-write snapshots,
    generation-checked storage/eviction, and a bounded darken-then-increase
    solver over explicit Unknown/KnownAir/Resident cells. Exact one-cell halo
    samples carry scheduler-owned trust and direct-sky provenance; unknown,
    dirty, or untrusted boundaries never seed light, Nether/End reject sky,
    and all propagation shares one enforced queue budget. WorldStream now owns
    the authoritative state metadata and bounded scheduling below; mesh baking,
    GPU/shader light consumption, and vanilla atmosphere parity remain open.
  - [x] Generate and ship bounded per-runtime-state light metadata without
    changing the reviewed `BREG1003`: `LREG1001` proves the exact protocol-state
    count, identity, property order, and committed-BREG SHA-256 before emitting
    one packed emission/filter byte per state. Dragonfly revision
    `dbbd8b787946e53b1def8d532050751dfcdc80e7` is authoritative for 16,911
    concrete states; exact, identifier-uniform pinned PMMP fallback supplies only
    `minecraft:redstone_lamp` and `minecraft:lit_redstone_lamp`, with deterministic
    provenance IDs/reporting and fail-closed disagreement/range checks. `MCBEAS05`
    atomically carries the byte beside each visual, exposes it through both
    sequential and network-hash resolution, rejects stale `MCBEAS04`, and names
    the `--light-registry` rebuild command. The solver and WorldStream scheduling
    integration are covered below; mesh baking, GPU/shader light consumption,
    vanilla sky/fog/cloud parity, and visual acceptance remain open.
  - [x] Derive a deterministic per-frame atmosphere snapshot from the app-owned
    clock and weather state: real elapsed time advances enabled sessions at 20
    ticks per second, explicitly disabled cycles freeze at their lock tick,
    signed times use
    Euclidean day and moon-phase wrapping, and rain/thunder remain bounded.
    Extract one stable 96-byte uniform, render the first procedural sky/sun/moon
    pass at reversed-Z far depth with per-view MSAA specialization, and apply
    camera-distance fog to chunk, model, and liquid paths without adding storage
    bindings or per-frame texture/bind-group churn. These checked curves and
    procedural disks establish the integration slice, not vanilla parity;
    asset-backed GPU hookup, precipitation visuals, underwater/lava medium fog,
    and live reference acceptance remain open.
  - [x] Pin and carry the exact vanilla sun, moon-phase atlas, and cloud texture
    in an independent bounded `MCBEATM1` runtime blob. The compiler requires the
    exact tracked Mojang manifest fields, canonical LF bytes (accepting only a
    uniform LF or Windows CRLF checkout), and per-source PNG hashes, records
    encoded and decoded hashes, rejects malformed/noncanonical layouts, and
    publishes only to ignored local paths. `make assets` and `make client`
    refresh the serialized blob/report pair through one portable producer;
    normalized, case-variant, symlink/junction, and hardlink output aliases fail
    before either write. Focused pinned tests, full assets/client-asset suites,
    strict Clippy, and independent re-review are green through `aed8d7f`; no
    Mojang payload is tracked.
  - [x] Load the required sibling `MCBEATM1` carrier once at startup and render
    its exact sun, 4x2 moon-phase atlas, and repeating cloud texture through the
    existing reversed-Z atmosphere phase. Three persistent GPU textures, one
    sampler, and one identity-cached bind group replace the procedural celestial
    disks without per-frame or per-subchunk resource churn; missing or malformed
    carriers fail hard with the exact rebuild command. Clouds use absolute world
    time, altitude 128, weather/fog fades, and a tested +X eastward speed of 0.03
    blocks per tick. Full app/render suites, strict Clippy, WGSL validation, and
    independent review are green through `4bf2c8c`; native multi-platform visual
    tuning and parity acceptance remain open.
    The original fixed 3x3 opaque finite-cloud visual behavior is superseded by
    `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-native-cloud-parity.md`: exact local-only
    1.26.33.1 occupancy, transparent depth-aware legacy composition, directional
    lighting, exact weather contributions, and calibrated native quality controls.
  - [x] Accept the exact local-only Bedrock 1.26.33.1 cloud PNG as an optional
    atmosphere compiler override without changing the pinned sun/moon inputs or
    `MCBEATM1` schema. The compiler fails closed on the exact 7,880-byte encoded
    SHA-256, 256x256 dimensions, decoded RGBA8 SHA-256, and 13,356 occupied
    texels; the runtime carrier and deterministic report retain only the canonical
    `textures/environment/clouds.png` logical path and independent hashes. The
    wrapper API and no-override fixture remain deterministic, while
    `assetc atmosphere --clouds-override` and optional `CINNABAR_CLOUDS_PNG`
    expose the local input portably. Both Make modes conservatively force the
    atmosphere producer, preventing a set-to-empty override transition from
    retaining a stale carrier. Startup evidence now identifies
    `cloud.wgsl` separately from `atmosphere.wgsl`. Synthetic rejection tests,
    synthetic accepted options tests through a private injected identity seam,
    a parsed-CLI-to-encoded-report test through the production command handler,
    environment-gated installed-input acceptance, the full assets suite, app asset
    suite, strict relevant Clippy, formatting, and diff checks are green;
    calibration and live parity acceptance remain open in the native-cloud plan.
  - [x] Replace opaque/depth-writing finite clouds with one transparent sorted
    render item using alpha blending, reversed-Z depth testing without depth
    writes, exact sequential rain/thunder colour contributions, real sun-vector
    directional lighting, bounded distance-fog alpha, and deterministic negative
    coordinate wrapping. Empty/sub-threshold alpha emits no geometry, GPU records
    and bind groups remain immutable, and collapsed/reversed/non-finite fog ranges
    fail to finite deterministic alpha. Focused meshing/render tests, WGSL/Naga
    validation, strict Clippy, formatting, independent review, and post-merge
    verification are green through `87e856f`. A live night run additionally
    proved that zero daylight could still make otherwise-transparent clouds
    pure black; clouds now share terrain's provisional `0.2` night sky-transfer
    floor through `e7c85ea`. **Forced-night native WGC evidence on `3bdb317`
    passed this colour gate:** cloud faces remained visibly medium gray against
    the purple night sky rather than becoming black. The same run was only
    16-18/11,760 chunks at about 8 FPS, so it is not a performance or full-view
    acceptance witness. Native geometry scale/density and
    above/below/within/grazing visual acceptance remain open.
    **Cloud geometry evidence contract complete (2026-07-16):** one bounded,
    identity-deduplicated `CLOUD_GEOMETRY_EVIDENCE calibrated=false` marker now
    records exact occupied texels, uploaded quad count/bytes, instance count,
    provisional 256-block period and Y=128..132 bounds, pinned High-quality
    native `grid_size=3`/`mesh_size=64`/`distance_scale=3` controls, and the
    atmosphere asset identity. It is produced only when a new atmosphere asset
    identity is prepared; no draw, shader, buffer topology, or per-frame work
    changed. Independent review and the complete render suite/strict checks are
    green through the merge following `c86d184`. The marker deliberately keeps
    `calibrated=false`: matching native views must derive the missing world-space
    mapping before the provisional layout changes.
  - [x] Resolve the camera-eye medium directly from palette-native liquid
    contributors, including secondary waterlogged layers, and use the exact
    two-triangle surface drawn by the shared quad index buffer for the air/water
    or air/lava transition, including noncoplanar corner heights. The sparse
    camera query reads packed indices and palette entries directly without
    constructing the mesher's allocating palette-fact cache; missing and
    non-finite samples fail open to air. Water and lava replace weather distance
    fog in the existing 96-byte atmosphere uniform, so chunk, model, liquid, and
    infinite-sky/celestial rendering share one medium response without a new
    binding or per-subchunk resource. The bounded water/lava colours and 32/3-
    block visibility ranges are the Phase 2.7 baseline; native reference
    calibration and precipitation visuals remain open.
  - [x] Compile and route exact pinned client biome/fog profiles by camera
    biome with Overworld/Nether/End fallback. `MCBATM2` carries the bounded,
    hashed environment-profile and fog-distance tables; biome-specific fog
    wins per medium and missing media layer from `minecraft:fog_default`.
    Fixed and render-relative air, weather, water, and lava endpoints plus
    exact sky colour now reach the shared atmosphere frame while clock,
    weather, and celestial state remain intact. Lighting and atmospherics
    identifiers are retained as explicit provisional routes rather than
    claimed native lighting calibration. Exact pinned-pack provenance,
    envelope, routing, render, and integration tests are green through
    `53fd591`.
  - [x] Wire the sparse solver and MCBEAS05 per-state emission/filter metadata
    into generation-qualified WorldStream light storage and bounded,
    nearest-first one-subchunk solves. Exact face block/light halos, dirty
    boundary trust, separately retained direct-sky provenance, decoded/update/
    eviction invalidation, convergent neighbour iteration, and current-light
    mesh scheduling are covered without flat block arrays. Mesh light baking,
    GPU/shader consumption, sky/fog/cloud rendering, and visual acceptance
    remain open.
    - Release scheduler workload gate on 2026-07-14: the exact radius-16 square
      (33×33 columns) across all 24 Overworld subchunks completed 26,136
      known-air light solves, with 26,136 uniform fast-path completions, zero
      stale completions, and all keys current in 1,006 ms. This measures the
      lighting scheduler only; live teleport/full-view remesh acceptance,
      mixed-block workloads and rendering acceptance remain open.
  - [x] Capture palette-native mesh lighting in a fixed 27-slot identity halo,
    gate mesh dispatch until every known slot is current, reject and losslessly
    requeue completions after exact light or direct-sky identity changes, and
    invalidate the center plus all 26 dependants on light completion, load, or
    eviction. Center/face/edge/corner routing and absent dark fallback read
    nibble channels directly without flat staging arrays. App tests passed
    233/233 (with one release-only test ignored), all app integration and world
    suites passed, and the exact release workload completed 26,136/26,136
    current subchunks with zero stale completions in 987 ms. The halo now
    implements the allocation-free render sampler and the worker calls the
    light-aware mesher. Cube, model, cross, and liquid CPU sidecars retain
    independent block/sky/AO channels; cube greedy merges split on exact packed
    lighting, and the cube sidecar survives bounded render-queue extraction
    with exact byte accounting. The combined app/render suites and strict
    Clippy are green. GPU arena/shader consumption, mixed-block visual
    acceptance, and live teleport full-view remesh acceptance remain open.
  - [x] Consume cube, model, and liquid light sidecars in the GPU world shaders
    without adding a buffer, bind group, or per-subchunk render resource. Commit
    `fe1a2ea` appends cube sidecars to the existing binding-13 arena, expands the
    per-draw origin ABI to carry exact cube/light bases, validates aligned and
    disjoint direct/MDI addressing, and converts discrete block/sky/AO samples
    at the vertex before smooth interpolation. Daylight affects only sky light;
    full solved skylight retains a named provisional `0.2` transfer floor at
    true night while block light remains independent. This floor is a
    conservative calibration to the existing horizon baseline, not a vanilla
    parity claim; native Bedrock reference tuning remains open. Alpha and fog
    ordering remain intact. Full render and app suites, strict
    combined Clippy, WGSL semantic/Metal-stage checks, formatting, and diff
    checks are green. Live mixed-block GPU parity and teleport/performance
    acceptance remain open.
  - [x] Preserve the authoritative all-air suffix omitted by limited-request
    `LevelChunk` columns and feed it into the sparse top-down skylight graph.
    `highest=0` columns require no outbound slot or packet; replacement,
    eviction, direct-sky propagation, and the final mesh-light sidecar are
    covered. This fixes the live zero-skylight world while leaving block light
    independent. Full client, render-atmosphere, asset, camera, strict Clippy,
    WGSL, and independent review gates are green through `7805402`. That commit's
    RGB black-key celestial workaround was later disproved by the pinned
    near-black border texels and is superseded by the additive tranche below.
  - [x] Keep solved light level zero visibly non-black through a named
    provisional `0.04` linear ambient floor applied after independent
    block/sky/daylight combination. The floor-to-one remap preserves every
    higher light step and exact full brightness instead of flattening low
    levels; AO remains independent. Native Bedrock capture tuning of the exact
    floor remains part of final visual acceptance.
  - [x] Composite the pinned opaque sun and all eight moon phases as emissive
    additions rather than RGB-keyed opaque replacements. A decoded `MCBEATM1`
    regression traverses every 32x32 tile border, covers the exact problematic
    sun `(1,1,0)` and moon `(0,0,1)` samples against bright and dark skies,
    preserves dark lunar detail and HDR energy, and Naga-validates the shared
    WGSL path. Startup now emits ordered full envelope/shader SHA-256 evidence
    without paths or payloads. Full workspace tests, strict Clippy/formatting,
    and independent re-review are green through `384e08a`; the live all-phase
    native/GDI comparison remains open in the visual blocker below.

Perf budget carried from Phase 0 gate; add: full remesh of view distance after teleport ≤ 2s.

**Edge anti-aliasing (2026-07-15):** [x] the client uses single-sample world
targets plus an FXAA-only post-process through `cd31f7a`. This replaces the
nominally portable 4x MSAA default after a real Radeon RX 570 DX12 adapter
presented black frames for every multisampled view (including a minimal Bevy
clear-color reproduction), while a macOS adapter had already rejected 8x
`Depth32Float`. Bevy's umbrella anti-alias plugin is disabled so unavailable
TAA/SMAA/CAS graph nodes are not installed; only `FxaaPlugin` runs. The full
280-test client suite, strict Clippy/formatting, release build, independent
review, and a fresh BDS/GDI above/within/below gallery are green. Higher
multisample modes remain conditional on a future capability- and live-tested
resolve path rather than a hardcoded camera sample count.

**Live visual acceptance (Computer Use):** run the Bevy app in representative vanilla
world scenes and compare visible results against the matching Mojang vanilla assets/reference
client at multiple distances and view angles. Verify exact texture/model selection, UV orientation
and wrapping, per-layer mip quality, opaque/cutout/blend behavior, flipbooks, biome tints,
block/sky lighting across day/night, fog, sky, and clouds. Exercise focus, keyboard input,
movement, and mouse-look/rotation during the pass. No placeholder/debug texture or visibly
non-vanilla rendering ships past this phase; record screenshots and any adjudicated parity gaps
in the phase report. If Computer Use window capture fails, take a native Windows screenshot,
store it only under the user's temporary directory, inspect that file, and never commit it.

**Open live defects (reported 2026-07-15; Phase 2 acceptance blockers):**

- [ ] Reproduce and eliminate the moving horizontal/vertical "TV static" or
  void-band artifact under camera motion. Separate presentation tearing from
  resident/frustum/submission loss with one identical-scene FIFO-versus-
  no-vsync capture and coherent resident/frustum/submitted/GPU-completed frame
  identities; do not change culling unless those identities prove a missing
  draw.
  - [x] Install bounded exact missing/extra key evidence through resident,
    cave, frustum, submitted, and GPU-completed stages for one coherent
    view/frame in both Direct and MDI paths. Acceptance defaults to FIFO;
    Immediate is an explicit A/B whose effective mode is proven from the
    primary surface capabilities with the same Bevy render instance/adapter,
    while absent/failed/fallback evidence rejects the comparison. Release
    profile, backend, adapter, and driver provenance plus PowerShell/Bash
    contracts passed independent review through `14db67f`.
  - [x] Remove the proven multisample resolve/presentation failure through
    `cd31f7a`: the affected Radeon DX12 adapter rendered black for every 4x
    MSAA view even in a minimal Bevy clear-colour reproduction, while the same
    release BDS scene renders through single-sample targets plus FXAA. The
    post-fix GDI gallery contains no black presentation or thin screen-space
    band, but this does not close the user-reported artifact without the
    binding identical-scene FIFO/Immediate motion comparison below.
  - [x] Make direct Windows launches and native visual inspection reliable
    through `1cad274`: default ignored-local assets fall back to the executable
    project root, Windows selects DX12 unless `WGPU_BACKEND` explicitly
    overrides it, and the local BDS scene was enumerated and captured through
    native Windows Graphics Capture at 1282x752. This closes the launch/capture
    tooling failure only; visual-parity and performance gates remain open.
  - [ ] Run the identical-scene release FIFO/Immediate capture, classify the
    artifact from coherent evidence, and eliminate the proven source.
- [ ] Make initial chunk publication and steady streaming meet the frame and
  teleport budgets without debug-only DX12 direct-draw collapse. Attribute
  decode, light-halo readiness, mesh queue wait, worker time, GPU-upload budget,
  render submission, and present latency independently; validate the final
  release path at radius 16 with no visible stalls and full-view remesh in at
  most two seconds.
  `P2-CHUNK-PUBLICATION`
  - [x] Eliminate unchanged-light publication churn through `39c44e8`: exact
    no-op and direct-sky-provenance-only completions preserve sampled light
    identity/generation and perform zero mesh invalidations, while genuine
    nibble changes retain the full 27-dependent invalidation contract. Exact
    saturating outcome counters and independent review are green; publication
    latency attribution, the full release benchmark, and live gates remain open.
  - [x] Attribute decode/light/mesh bounded-queue wait independently from
    worker duration and emit one coherent periodic publication snapshot that
    joins outcome counters, pending/in-flight gauges, upload bytes, draw mode,
    build profile, present proof, and adapter provenance. PowerShell and Bash
    reject missing, extra, duplicate, malformed, wrong-typed, or mismatched
    rows. Full client/script suites, strict Clippy/formatting, adversarial
    contract tests, and independent re-review are green through `0811c0a`;
    the full release radius-16 benchmark and live resource gates remain open.
  - [x] Install one shared adaptive item-and-byte publication budget across
    world handoff, main-world application, extraction, and GPU preparation.
    Genuine frame-pressure stalls reduce the budget multiplicatively, normal
    FIFO pacing is tolerated, and sustained healthy frames recover
    conservatively; nearest-first ordering and exact cohort identities remain
    unchanged. Zero-byte removals retain a separate 256-operation hard cap,
    and whole-arena growth copies are reserved inside the same GPU byte budget.
    Deterministic pressure, continuity, accounting, app, client-world, and
    render tests plus independent review are green through `9ea25e1`; the live
    radius-16 <=2-second acceptance gate remains open.
  - [x] Prove the deterministic full radius-16 publication path through
    `7098b65`: 26,136 current subchunks pass accepted lighting, meshing,
    main-world queue application, real render extraction, production GPU
    preparation, and exact acknowledgement in 1,369 ms on the integration
    rerun. The 64 populated witnesses produced 190,384 positive upload bytes;
    31,786 known-air removals completed without spending the production
    128-item non-empty upload budget, while all applications remained capped at
    256 per frame. Zero stale, pending, in-flight, duplicate, or
    unacknowledged work remained. Full render/client suites, strict
    Clippy/formatting, and three independent reviews are green. This closes only
    deterministic Task 3 Steps 1–3; the release BDS join/teleport,
    presentation, RSS, settled-CPU, and visible-stall gate remains open.
  - [x] Ship the bounded publication, same-connection fast-transfer recovery,
    and player-near request-priority implementation on canonical
    `phase2-textures` through `2fc7a33`. The combined history includes bounded
    publication at `dedbef1`, local reset and request-ordering work from
    `a7d8a90` through `c4ed5a9`, integration at `f0f27eb`, vanilla slash
    `CommandRequest` encoding at `be32657`, and final cross-platform CI repairs.
    Canonical CI run `29671070071` is green. This is an implementation-only
    milestone: the binding LBSG same-connection reset witness, ordered
    Lunar/Zeqa native evidence, and the master <=2-second live gate remain open.
  - [x] Remove the frame-coupled four-decode throttle through `2b16368`.
    The 2026-07-15 opt-in live trace proved that all 4,912 admitted jobs
    completed (3,988 SubChunk jobs at about 0.02 ms each), while 1,218 frames
    over 180 seconds limited throughput to 27.29 jobs/s solely because only
    four jobs could dispatch per frame. Decode dispatch now drains the already
    bounded 32-heavy-event admission window in one poll; retained payloads
    remain capped at 32 and the result channel at 128. The deterministic
    regression, all 284 client unit tests (two ignored), strict Clippy,
    formatting, and CI are green.
  - [ ] Replace the provisional universal Euclidean publisher-disk rule with
    per-publisher-epoch membership from unique FIFO-committed request-mode
    `LevelChunk` announcements. The raw block radius remains a separate
    retention/classification witness: it does not define one protocol-wide
    enumerable cohort. The earlier BDS-specific run through `1fdd874` observed
    797 complete columns, while authoritative Lunar raw-128 evidence observes
    exactly 177; Dragonfly's attributable classifier gives 177 at raw 128 and
    749 at raw 256, and raw 120 => 177 remains labeled compatibility policy.
    A later unique announcement must expand the same epoch and invalidate the
    frozen count/hash/presentation proof; publisher identity, session, and
    dimension changes reset membership. Exact source eviction and GPU-manifest
    evidence remain mandatory. Earlier independent verification passed all 289
    client unit tests (two ignored), the 43/14/14 integration groups, strict
    Clippy, formatting, and diff checks. Live DX12/FIFO BDS run
    `20260716T001125Z-16608` reached `exact=true` with its 797 announced
    columns, 22,488 resident subchunks, 14,018 known-air
    subchunks, zero source/foreign evidence, and every network, request,
    decode, light, mesh, render-upload, and acknowledgement queue drained to
    zero. The run still timed out after this boundary because no binding pair
    of exact GPU-completed presented-frame acknowledgements was published;
    presentation-gate diagnosis and the <=2-second remesh gate remain open.
  - [x] Correct exact presented-frame acknowledgement for legitimately culled
    resident allocations through `9a195c1`. The gate still proves the complete
    target GPU allocation manifest, exact generations, and zero missing,
    unexpected, source, foreign, stale, or orphan evidence, but now requires
    every stable visible allocation to be drawn instead of incorrectly requiring
    every hidden allocation to be drawn in one frame. Two adjacent frames must
    retain the same visible manifest. The visible-undrawn, hidden-resident,
    visibility-churn, and skipped-frame regressions are green along with all 157
    render tests, 289 client unit tests (two ignored), strict Clippy, formatting,
    and diff checks. Live DX12/FIFO run `20260716T003124Z-7592` advanced through
    `RUST_MCBE_TELEPORT_SETTLED` with a complete 6,951-allocation manifest and a
    stable 1,676-allocation visible/drawn subset, with every contamination
    counter zero. The binding far teleport still took 48,128 ms and the forced
    full-view remesh did not finish inside the 60-second timed session; peak
    pending meshes reached 43,024, maximum mesh queue wait reached 30,833 ms,
    and the final snapshot still had 148 uploads queued. The <=2-second live
    remesh/performance gate therefore remains open and is the next publication
    bottleneck.
  - [x] Remove semantically empty work from the forced acceptance remesh. Trace
    attribution of `20260716T003124Z-7592` proved that the old gate scheduled all
    22,488 resident identities even though only 6,951 had published GPU
    allocations: 14,018 known-air plus 1,519 packed-empty identities created
    15,537 guaranteed no-mesh jobs, 69.1% of the forced cohort. The gate now
    remeshes the teleport's complete frozen allocation manifest, never its
    visible subset, and fails closed on empty, duplicate, stale-generation, or
    nonresident entries. Exact cohort hashes, forced generations, full
    allocation identity, zero contamination, and the adjacent GPU-presented
    frame proof remain unchanged. This reduces the hard application floor from
    88 to 55 frames; it does not yet prove the binding two-second gate. All 292
    active client unit tests plus the 43/14/14 integration groups, strict Clippy,
    formatting, and diff checks pass. A fresh live run must measure the new
    floor and determine whether baseline frame rate or upload scheduling is the
    next limiter.
    **Live result (2026-07-15):** release DX12/FIFO run
    `20260716T052758Z-9172` retained the exact 6,951-allocation cohort and zero
    contamination, then completed the forced remesh in 8,596 ms over 67 frames
    instead of timing out. The binding teleport remained 48,547 ms. At roughly
    eight presented frames per second, the current 128-nonempty/256-total
    frame-coupled budgets impose a 55-frame theoretical minimum, so adaptive
    upload/application scheduling is now the measured next limiter. The script
    failed only after both binding markers when its 60-second client exited
    during the later steady-resource sample; no final resource pass is claimed.
- [ ] Remove every dark rectangle/background pixel around the pinned sun and
  moon textures. The acceptance test must exercise decoded pinned pixels and
  mip/filter edges, not merely string-inspect WGSL, and must prove both bodies
  against bright and dark skies across all moon phases.
  - [x] Land the decoded-border additive composition and path-independent
    envelope/shader identity tranche through `384e08a`.
  - [ ] Run fresh release/GDI views against the matching native client for sun
    and all moon phases, including horizon and filter-edge cases, before
    closing the visible defect.
- [ ] Replace the current infinitely thin cloud plane with a vanilla-parity
  cloud volume/layer that has visible thickness and side faces while retaining
  bounded GPU cost, world anchoring, weather/fog fades, and the existing shared
  atmosphere resource architecture. Verify from above, below, within, and at
  grazing angles against matching native reference captures.
  - [x] Record the installed native occupancy/material/config evidence and the
    reviewed greedy packed finite-mesh design/implementation plan in
    `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-15-finite-cloud-mesh-design.md` and
    `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-15-finite-cloud-mesh.md`.
  - [x] Implement and independently review the deterministic periodic CPU
    mesher: exact 256x256 alpha occupancy, toroidal seam culling, greedy exposed
    faces, an eight-byte packed ABI, checked worst-case ceilings, and canonical
    snapped 3x3 origins are green through `03a8c3a`.
  - [x] Render that finite mesh through one identity-cached custom GPU pipeline
    with immutable eight-byte quad records, vertex pulling, one nine-instance
    draw, physical reversed-Z depth, per-view MSAA/HDR specialization, bounded
    weather/fog shading, and explicit Metal-safe binding visibility. The old
    fullscreen sampled plane is removed. Full render/client suites, strict
    workspace Clippy/formatting, and independent review are green through
    `e2d0ea8`; native visual and performance acceptance remains open.
  - [ ] Resolve the 2026-07-15 live user rejection that the finite clouds look
    substantially non-vanilla. Reproduce the exact visible scale, thickness,
    silhouette, face shading, motion, fog, and seam behavior against the
    matching native Bedrock client, correct the proven differences, and obtain
    a fresh accepted above/below/within/grazing gallery before closing this
    blocker. Deterministic mesher/pipeline tests alone do not satisfy it. The
    first live/evidence audit proves three root mismatches that must be removed:
    the compiled `v1.26.30.32-preview` mask differs from the installed 1.26.33.1
    mask at 24,175/65,536 occupancy coordinates; the fixed 3x3 256-period draw
    ignores native `cloud_mesh_size: 64`, quality grid, and distance controls;
    and the opaque, depth-writing, fixed-face shader contradicts native
    transparent, directional-light, and exact weather-colour inputs. Exact
    native cloud bytes remain local build inputs and must never be committed.
    The opaque/depth-writing/material mismatch is resolved through `87e856f`;
    native mesh size, quality/distance controls, density, scale, thickness,
    silhouette, and live gallery acceptance remain open.
  - [ ] Implement, independently review, and live-verify the finite cloud mesh.

## Phase 3 — Movement and the local player `P3-MOVEMENT`

**Goal:** playable movement that servers accept. Deliverable: walk/sprint/jump/sneak/swim/
climb on a vanilla parkour course and on Lunar-fronted servers with server-auth movement,
no rubber-banding.

Scope: input → `PlayerAuthInput` at 20Hz with correct flags; client prediction in `crates/sim`
as a **behavioral port of bedsim** — test strategy: golden traces (bedsim runs input scripts →
JSONL of per-tick positions; Rust sim must match within epsilon; reuse the pathfind-bot log
tooling patterns); collision against `crates/world`; camera = per-frame interpolation of
tick states; correction/rewind handling (`CorrectPlayerMovePrediction`).

- [x] **3.1 Server-bound movement foundation.** A vendor-neutral Rust movement snapshot now
  maps byte-for-byte to gophertunnel's protocol-1001 `PlayerAuthInput` fixture, including the
  current position/delta, processed/analogue/raw move vectors, rotation, input flags, input
  mode, camera orientation, and server tick. A deterministic 20 Hz scheduler, bounded 32-tick
  retry FIFO, StartGame/session reset, and `CorrectPlayerMovePrediction` reanchoring are in
  place behind an explicit movement-source authority gate. The gate defaults to `FreeCamera`,
  and outbound free-camera `PlayerAuthInput`/position updates are suppressed completely;
  StartGame and corrections cannot authorize them. Only the future `Physics` source may use
  the scheduler and transmit. Real movement remains incomplete until the bedsim-parity
  fixed-tick simulation, collision, prediction/history/rewind replay, and render interpolation
  are implemented and wired to that source.

- [x] **3.2 Physics-safe simulation foundation.** `crates/sim` now provides transactional
  one-call/one-20-Hz fixed ticks, feet-origin player AABBs, bedsim-order swept collision and
  stepping, basic walk/sprint/jump/sneak forces, packed-palette `crates/world` collision queries,
  and bounded tick-keyed correction replay. Unknown runtime IDs, unloaded chunks, invalid
  collision shapes, and failed replay queries stop prediction instead of guessing. A generator
  pinned to bedsim v0.1.3 records a checksum-bound JSONL trace, and the Rust conformance test
  matches it at `1e-12` epsilon. App integration is tracked separately in 3.3. Remaining bedsim
  movement strata, expanded terrain/correction traces, and live vanilla/Lunar verification
  remain required before Phase 3 is complete. Freecam remains a non-authoritative mode and
  must be network-silent.

- [x] **3.2a Current-BDS movement reconciliation correction.** A recovered
  Bedrock 1.16.201 `ServerPlayer` path initially suggested that takeoff should
  switch to air acceleration and drag before horizontal travel. A strict
  server-authoritative BDS 1.26.32.2 run disproved that as the target-version
  contract: over the six ticks ending at the jump apex, the server advanced
  `0.85394` blocks, matching the pinned bedsim ground-takeoff/ground-drag
  ordering rather than the provisional air-first result (`0.75231`, corrected
  by `0.10162`). The simulator therefore retains its checksum-bound bedsim
  equations; the older recovered implementation is not used as a current
  vanilla authority.
  The same strict run exposed the actual live defect: every retained
  `CorrectPlayerMovePrediction` rebuilt its tick from position-only state,
  erasing velocity and restarting acceleration even for a `0.000017`-block
  correction. Correction replay now replaces the server-owned position and
  grounded flag while retaining velocity, movement, and jump state before
  replaying later inputs. Unconfirmed collision flags and their dependent
  upward ladder velocity are still cleared.
  Strict current-BDS confirmation at commit `5312070` used
  `server-authoritative-movement-strict=true` and a `0.001` position threshold.
  An 18-tick uninterrupted ground walk received only `0.000017`–`0.000124`
  corrections while acceleration continued through each six-tick correction;
  an open jump received only `0.000015`–`0.000126` corrections through takeoff,
  apex, landing, and continued travel. This closes the correction-reset defect,
  not the Phase 3 native-client visual/feel acceptance gate.

- [x] **3.3 App-side local physics integration foundation.** App input now drives the fixed
  20 Hz simulator against checked-in sequential and hashed collision registries; unavailable
  collision data fails closed, render frames interpolate the simulated eye position, and
  session/correction events reanchor or reset prediction without leaking into teleport
  tracking. Catch-up, history, and input-edge queues remain bounded. This landed through
  `71d38a3` and merge `e370880`; 25 focused movement tests, the complete client-world and sim
  suites, the full locked Rust workspace, strict workspace Clippy, formatting, and architecture
  enforcement are green. The controller deliberately cannot authorize network transmission:
  production remains `FreeCamera` and sends no local position updates. Enabling `Physics`
  authority requires the remaining movement strata plus live server-authoritative verification.

- **PR #6 Phase 3 integration record (2026-07-26).** Both independently reviewed lanes landed
  with history preserved. The input-parity lane `codex/pr6-input-parity` was approved at
  `c1bb584` after five independent Sol-high review rounds and four fix rounds, with final
  decision `APPROVE` and no findings, then landed as merge `cfdf897`. The correction and
  acceptance lane `agent/pr6-phase3-completion` was approved at `e099529` after six independent
  Sol-high review rounds and five fix rounds, with final decision `APPROVE` and no findings,
  then landed as merge `a9593e7`.
  - Post-integration deterministic verification on the merged tree passed:
    `cargo test -p semantic-input --locked` (53 passed);
    `cargo test -p bedrock-client --locked` (lib 420, assets 41, hud_assets 9,
    inventory_router 3, physics_assets 2, doctest 1; all passed);
    `cargo test -p protocol --locked` (21 test binaries, all passed);
    `cargo test -p client-world --locked` (lib 236 passed / 1 ignored,
    entity_runtime 11, item_actions 14; all passed);
    `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passed;
    `git diff --check` passed;
    `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` passed with zero
    warnings and is CI's exact Clippy command; and
    `Invoke-Pester -Script 'scripts/tests/acceptance/Phase3.Tests.ps1' -PassThru` passed
    89/89.
  - `cargo test --workspace --locked` was not run locally as a single invocation. The
    per-crate suites above were run instead; CI runs the workspace form.
  - Implementation and deterministic verification are complete. Native/live and performance
    acceptance remain open and are **not** closed; Phase 3 is not complete. No native/live
    acceptance checkbox is closed by this integration.
  - Production outbound `Physics` transmission remains intentionally disabled. Enabling it is
    a separate reviewed change.
  - The network lifecycle emits one bootstrap per `NetworkHandle`; same-handle session
    replacement remains a known uncovered lifecycle.
  - Follow-up harness correction: by owner decision touch parity is deprioritized and does
    not gate Phase 3 acceptance. `CandidatePhysics` requires keyboard/mouse and gamepad
    witnesses, while its manifest and final evidence name Touch as `Deferred`, attribute the
    deferral to the owner decision, and leave touch parity open rather than treating it as
    observed or satisfied.
  - `Phase3Launcher.ps1` now supports authenticated `Zeno` runs at
    `zenomc.org:19197`, following the same candidate/free-camera scenario and five-minute
    minimum used by the other external targets. Zeno is the low-population official-BDS
    server-authority target for movement rejection and correction checks.
  - Pre-existing, out-of-scope observation: adding `--all-features` to Clippy fails in the
    vendored `crates/protocol/vendor/jolyne` crate because optional dependencies are not
    vendored. This work did not cause that failure, and CI does not use `--all-features`.

- **Phase 3 local BDS smoke findings (2026-07-26, four runs at BDS 1.26.32.2).**
  These runs found defects; they did not validate native parity, remote-server behavior, or
  Phase 3 acceptance and do not advance Phase 3 closure. Phase 3 remains incomplete; native/live
  and performance acceptance remain open.
  - Fixed and confirmed only against local BDS 1.26.32.2: blob-cache admission exhaustion at
    the former 256-transaction cap was fatal and is now recoverable, improving session survival
    from 9.1 seconds to 114–187 seconds. Zero-blob cache-miss responses were incorrectly treated
    as invalid, causing arbitrary FIFO retirement and a feedback loop; they are now successful
    no-ops, with live runs reporting `skipped_miss_responses = 0`,
    `retired_cached_transactions = 0`, and 283 / 4,666 empty responses handled cleanly.
    Skip telemetry is now separated by reason and resync lifecycle counters exist; this
    observability isolated the remaining defect in one run. Before the loop fix, measured join
    high-water marks were 1,194 / 845 pending transactions, independently showing that the old
    256 cap was under-calibrated.
  - Open, root-caused, and not fixed: blob-cache FIFO head-of-line blocking in
    `crates/protocol/src/blob_cache/resolver.rs`. Cached chunks, ordinary packets, and world
    events share one `pending + ready` budget (`resolver.rs:153`, `:249-254`, `:287-292`,
    `:454-459`), while draining requires the front transaction to have every hash cached
    (`:811-817`). One unresolved cached transaction therefore blocks hash-free world events and
    all later work. At capacity cached packets are skipped (`:387-392`), and world events are
    silently and permanently discarded without stored retry or resync (`:271-275`).
  - Live evidence at `b29966d`: pending transactions pinned at 2,047/2,048 in both scenarios;
    `skipped_world_events` was 9,139 / 15,002 and cached transaction-pressure skips were
    2,312 / 3,953. Byte-pressure, semantic-shape, unsolicited, and integrity skips were all
    zero, as were all resync lifecycle counters.
  - Pressure-skipped `SubChunk` packets receive no resync because
    `queue_level_chunk_resync` returns `None` for non-`LevelChunk` packets
    (`resolver/helpers.rs:35-40`). They fall back to two client-world retries
    (`stream.rs:101-102`), then finish with `collision_authoritative = false`
    (`stream/retries.rs:247-255`) while the column is still added to `loaded_columns`
    (`retries.rs:39-47`), so cohort completeness can be misleading. Consequently
    `mutation_coordinate` remains `null` (`app-metrics.json:7`);
    `RUST_MCBE_WORLD_READY` never fires (`app/src/acceptance/mutation.rs:270-272`), the
    60-second acceptance clock never arms, and runs hang until the launcher's 180-second bound.
    **No `phase3-final.json` has ever been produced; there is no Phase 3 acceptance verdict of
    any kind.**
  - Open separate defect: the local Go bridge reported
    `invalid checksum of packet 6217`, then the local listener was forcibly closed
    (OS error 10054). Saturation is neither its cause nor consequence: FreeCamera saturated
    well before it, while CandidatePhysics saturated more severely without a checksum error.
    Likely investigation targets are cipher-counter divergence, send-buffer reuse, or frame
    corruption in the Rust-to-Go bridge; this needs a separate instrumented investigation.
  - Open and unchanged: every CandidatePhysics run still reports `physics_tick_overflow` with
    `detail.dropped = 5` and an authority-fault violation. The prior diagnosis is that
    "collision data unavailable, wait" and "cannot keep up, dropped time" are conflated in
    `dropped_ticks`, and any nonzero value revokes authority. This is not fixed.

- **PR #6 resumed closure record (2026-08-02, local commit `17d3627`).** The previously open
  resolver, transport, collision-readiness, and movement-admission defects above are fixed in the
  PR worktree, but the commit is not pushed and Phase 3 remains incomplete.
  - Blob-cache cached, ordinary, and recovery lanes are independently bounded; pressure no longer
    pins ordinary intake. Cached SubChunk admission is explicitly rolled back with exact-Y
    recovery only when client-world recorded that admission. Coalesced and stale admissions clear
    all markers before one bounded retry. Pending and reconstructed-but-unpublished transactions
    preserve rollback across semantic and transfer resets.
  - Cached status delivery is cancellation-safe. Socket transport retains the exact encrypted
    frame, the session drains that frame before exposing admission, and transfer rollback is
    emitted before any replacement-candidate status or admission.
  - This interim commit defaulted production to server-authoritative `Physics`; the final
    integration head recorded below restores the binding candidate-only gate. Its bounded
    fixed-tick catch-up, collision readiness, reanchor, send cancellation, and terminal-drain
    paths retain or fail closed instead of silently dropping movement authority.
  - Deterministic verification at this commit passed 2,472 workspace tests (13 ignored),
    strict workspace Clippy, formatting, 106 Phase 3/FastTransfer Pester contracts, focused
    rollback/reset/cancellation regressions, and the debug client build. Independent latest-diff
    review returned correct with no blocking findings.
  - The committed local BDS `FreeCameraSilence` run
    `phase3-020595ebff304770b201765b51070585` did **not** close live acceptance. It timed out:
    terminal telemetry reported 256 retained cache transactions, 5,626 pressure skips,
    31 recovery requests, 12,770 pending mesh jobs, a one-item publication cap, and no clean
    shutdown. The run rendered 477 resident meshes but remained under sustained load.
    Release-budget evidence, a version-matched native lighting comparison, clean live shutdown,
    integration, and final PR acceptance therefore remain open. The Linux acceptance shell suite
    also remains unexecuted on this workstation because no usable Python/WSL runtime is installed.

- **PR #6 blob-pressure convergence follow-up (2026-08-02, local commit `4726be0`).**
  The cache-pressure deadlock exposed by the committed run above is fixed and independently
  reviewed, but Phase 3 acceptance remains open.
  - The terminal state at `676719f` retained 255 unresolved transactions plus one same-column
    reconstructed transaction, then later all 256 slots as unresolved work. New cached packets
    were skipped indefinitely, so incomplete columns could not enter `loaded_columns`; the
    unmodified 3x3 lighting-context gate correctly retained 1,968 light jobs with no worker able
    to dispatch them.
  - At the transaction or aggregate recovery-slot bound, the resolver now rotates the
    deterministic oldest unresolved transaction through its existing exact recovery and
    hash-owner promotion path. LevelChunk replacement can use the released slot immediately.
    SubChunk replacement waits until the prior exact recovery is observable, preventing a new
    admission from being erased by an older rollback. Distinct and coalesced secondary recoveries
    retain exact request/accounting counts, including staged- and pending-byte rejection.
  - Deterministic verification passed all 282 protocol tests. Focused regressions cover both
    transitions to the transaction bound, eventual multi-column SubChunk admission, same-position
    recovery-before-admission ordering, and distinct/coalesced recovery accounting. Independent
    latest-diff review found no remaining blocker.
  - Clean committed BDS run `phase3-3e439a915ab648619f496236364297c8` proved the deadlock removed:
    the required cohort reached 314/314; pending light work fell to zero; pending mesh work fell to
    zero; transparent sorting committed and presented generation 1,020; and shutdown completed
    with app exit code 0. Cache occupancy continued bounded 255/256 rotation instead of pinning
    publication.
  - The launcher still timed out and `world_ready` remained false, so this is not Phase 3
    acceptance. The remaining world-ready predicate, release-budget evidence, version-matched
    native lighting comparison, integration, and final PR acceptance remain open.

- **PR #6 world-ready acceptance follow-up (2026-08-02, local commit `a8d0866`).**
  The cache-enabled BDS `FreeCameraSilence` path now produces a clean, attributable
  verdict, but this debug run does not close Phase 3 performance or native-parity gates.
  - `phase3-180d6ca5fd7e4dd2b28999c10cabe8c1` is a clean 60-second run built from
    `a8d0866`: `phase3-final.json` is `valid`, `WORLD_READY` was emitted, the app and
    core both exited 0, and the launcher did not time out.
  - Vanilla BDS load peaked at 1,695 retained/pending blob transactions after raising
    the client admission bound to the measured server burst. Intake never skipped a
    packet, no cached transaction was abandoned, and no recovery request was needed;
    the prior 256-entry pressure loop is absent. Redundant missing requests and empty
    miss responses remain measured efficiency work, not a demonstrated correctness
    failure in this run.
  - World-ready presentation now accepts a stable drawn superset of the visible
    allocation manifest while requiring identical drawn manifests across the two
    frames. Relevant admitted network ingress, forced-remesh evidence, and world-ready
    presentation each carry an independent monotonic fence, and camera input is frozen
    only while the presentation gate is armed.
  - Deterministic verification at this commit passed 2,487 workspace tests (13 ignored),
    strict workspace Clippy, formatting, 93 Phase 3 Pester contracts, focused render and
    world-ready suites, and the debug client build. Independent latest-diff review
    approved each behavioral tranche.
  - This was a debug `FreeCameraSilence` smoke, averaging 7.62 FPS while the world
    streamed. It is not release-performance evidence. CandidatePhysics, external-server
    matrices, version-matched native comparison, release budgets, integration, and final
    PR acceptance remain open.

- **PR #6 final integration follow-up (2026-08-02, local commit `f381a19`).**
  The final local head is not yet pushed or integrated.
  - Normal production sessions again install `PhysicsAuthorityGate::ProductionDisabled`.
    `CandidatePhysics` and authenticated `FastTransferWitness` are the only attributable
    harness lanes that add `--phase3-candidate-physics`; `FreeCameraSilence` remains
    candidate-free and adds only `--auto-fly`. Dry-run and final evidence both report
    `production_physics_default_enabled=false`.
  - The first pushed-head CI run exposed ten architecture-size violations. Coherent private
    module/test extractions now restore the unchanged policy without deleting coverage or
    relaxing a limit; the exact local architecture check passes.
  - A final live run exposed a nondeterministic process hang after `app.run()` returned.
    The bounded shutdown watchdog had been completed before synchronous network/App cleanup.
    The watchdog now remains armed through `NetworkHandle::shutdown()` and explicit App drop;
    `SHUTDOWN_COMPLETED` is emitted only after both return.
  - Clean BDS run `phase3-1326f452cbe34833b1d5da44c81b6ca0` at `f381a19` produced a
    `valid` 60-second `FreeCameraSilence` verdict, `WORLD_READY`, app/core exit code 0, no
    launcher timeout, no watchdog firing, and an ordered `SHUTDOWN_WATCHDOG_ARMED` then
    `SHUTDOWN_COMPLETED` tail.
  - The final safety integration passes formatting, the architecture checker, all 496
    bedrock-client tests, strict bedrock-client Clippy, and all 106 Phase 3/FastTransfer
    Pester contracts. The preceding integrated head passed all 2,487 workspace tests and
    strict workspace Clippy. Linux acceptance remains delegated to CI because this workstation
    has no WSL distribution.
  - This is one BDS FreeCamera smoke, not CandidatePhysics, external-server, native-parity,
    release-performance, or Phase 3 closure evidence. Those gates remain open after PR merge.

- [ ] **3.4 Semantic controls and camera perspectives.** `P3.4-INPUT-CAMERA`
  Touch parity remains an explicit open closure item. Its owner-deprioritized witness does
  not gate the Phase 3 scenario verdict, and a passing candidate run does not close touch.

## Phase 4 — Entities and other players

Scope: actor lifecycle packets, metadata/attributes, movement interpolation, biped rendering
with standard + persona skins (skin data arrives via PlayerList/AddPlayer), name tags, vanilla
mob geometry + textures from bedrock-samples, **molang subset** for vanilla animation
controllers (walk cycles, look-at; documented cut-line, static pose fallback), item entities
and dropped-item rendering, paper-doll first-person arm/held item.

**Phase 4 progress (kept current as work lands):**

- [x] **4.1 Bounded actor lifecycle ingestion.** The protocol layer now materializes and
  normalizes `AddPlayer`, `AddActor`/`AddEntity`, `RemoveActor`/`RemoveEntity`, absolute and
  delta actor movement, `SetActorData`/`SetEntityData`, `UpdateAttributes`, and `PlayerList`
  into vendor-neutral events. All retained identifiers, names, metadata/NBT, attributes,
  modifiers, properties, and roster collections have explicit limits and finite-number
  validation. The app owns a sparse runtime-ID actor store with a unique-ID removal index,
  atomic duplicate replacement, bounded player roster, FIFO/session/dimension rejection, and
  dimension/session reset semantics. Foreign `MovePlayer` packets route to this actor stream
  without entering the local-camera path, and actor updates do not dirty chunk/light/mesh
  state. This substep deliberately does **not** implement entity rendering, interpolation,
  skins/persona data, Molang, name tags, or item/first-person visuals; those remain open Phase 4
  work.

- [x] **4.2 Standard remote-player render slice.** `PlayerList` now retains explicitly bounded
  classic 64x64, 128x128, or 256x256 RGBA skin images, with deterministic unavailable states for
  persona, malformed, or retained-budget-exhausted data; `AddPlayer` UUIDs join those roster
  profiles to the sparse actor store, whose cumulative retained skin bytes remain capped across
  incremental roster packets. Foreign `MovePlayer` metadata preserves head yaw, ground state,
  mode, and signed source tick while retaining explicit packet-coordinate origin. `AddPlayer`
  and `AddActor` remain feet-space, while `MovePlayer` and absolute actor movement are normalized
  exactly once after retained actor kind and metadata are known. Standing players use Bedrock's
  `1.62001` offset; sleeping players use `0.2` only when retained sleeping flags prove the pose;
  retained item actors, falling blocks, and the reviewed vanilla minecart identifiers use `0.5`;
  `minecraft:boat` uses `0.375`; and primed TNT uses half its retained bounding-box height with
  the vanilla `0.49` default. The
  separate `AddItemEntity` spawn packet still awaits ingestion. Partial/delta movement and actors
  without a reviewed offset remain unchanged. The client-world store performs
  Oomph-style three-20-Hz-tick player convergence;
  teleports and actor replacement snap immediately, and the renderer performs the distinct
  adjacent-tick frame interpolation with shortest-path angles. Camera-frustum and conservative
  192-block distance culling happen before the runtime-ID-ordered 128-instance upload cap, so
  invisible players cannot displace visible ones. This path consumes no free-camera or local
  movement state and sends no free-camera position updates. One
  custom `Opaque3d` instanced draw expands a shared six-cuboid standard
  Bedrock biped vertex buffer and samples a bounded 64x64 texture array, with no `StandardMaterial`
  or per-actor Bevy mesh. Missing/unsupported/invalid skins use the documented, locally generated
  `Cinnabar Default` skin (no Mojang or diagnostic bytes). Focused protocol/app/render tests,
  shader parsing, no-op-backend binding-layout validation, pipeline specialization, format, and
  warnings-denied workspace Clippy are green. Persona/custom geometry,
  legacy 64x32 skins, outer skin layers, limb animation/Molang, name tags, equipment, mobs/items,
  first-person visuals, live render-pipeline creation on a hardware backend, and multi-client
  visual evidence remain open Phase 4 work.
  The complete absolute-movement origin correction, regression suite, independent review, and
  post-merge protocol/client-world/app verification are green through `e7c85ea`; the LBSG live
  ground-contact witness remains open under 4.4.

- [ ] **4.3 Data-driven Bedrock entity rigs and animation.** `P4.3-RIGS` Ingest the pinned
  vanilla resource pack's `entity`, `models/entity`, `animations`,
  `animation_controllers`, `render_controllers`, and `textures/entity` trees as
  bounded compiled assets. Evaluate only the reviewed Molang subset needed by
  those controllers, drive poses from protocol metadata/attributes and the
  20-Hz actor state, then perform the distinct adjacent-tick frame
  interpolation in the renderer. Preserve shared geometry/material/texture
  storage and bounded per-frame actor work. Decompiled Minecraft Java Edition
  code or assets must not be copied into Cinnabar; Java behavior may only be an
  independently observed clean-room comparison when the authoritative Bedrock
  pack is ambiguous.
  **Bounded asset-catalog tranche complete (2026-07-16):** the pinned vanilla
  `entity`, geometry, animation, animation-controller, render-controller, and
  entity-texture trees now compile into the deterministic `MCBEENT3` carrier
  with exact source-manifest provenance. The real reviewed pack produces 3,247
  source records, 2,993 symbols, and 3,071 dependency edges (2,929 internal and
  142 explicitly external); duplicate identifiers remain selectable candidates
  rather than silently choosing a generation. Texture identifiers and
  conditional render-controller keys resolve canonically, startup fails closed
  on stale provenance, and generated carriers/reports and Mojang payloads remain
  ignored. Independent review and post-merge assets/compiler/client tests and
  strict checks are green. **Geometry payload tranche complete (2026-07-16):**
  the carrier now preserves bounded, deterministic geometry, bone, cube,
  pivot/rotation, mirror, inflate, and UV payloads. Legacy inheritance resolves
  sparse overlays through the selected parent chain, exact reviewed legacy/modern
  schema versions fail closed, and geometry JSON rejects duplicate semantic keys
  recursively. The complete `105107d..d84667d` behavior range received fresh APPROVE
  after all three Important review findings were fixed and landed as merge `1e4ba3c`.
  The subsequent behavior-preserving compiler split through `4a6696b` independently
  passed review and architecture enforcement and landed as merge `73b8de7`.
  Animation clip payloads, the reviewed Molang/controller evaluator, runtime rig
  consumption and skeletal GPU skinning/posing, and native animated-actor evidence
  remain open.
- [ ] **4.4 Live actor ground-contact and interpolation witness.** `P4.4-LIVE-ACTOR` Join
  `play.lbsg.net:19132` with the normal authenticated core, observe at least one
  remote player's spawn, ordinary movement, rotation, and teleport, and prove
  that AddPlayer/MovePlayer origins, three-tick convergence, frame
  interpolation, and the shared biped model keep both feet on the same ground
  plane without a 1.6-block jump. Keep the visual standing eye height (`1.62`)
  distinct from Bedrock's standing-player movement network offset (`1.62001`).
  Capture bounded native visual and packet/pose evidence.

- [ ] **4.5 Held items, actions, dropped items, and viewmodel.** `P4.5-ITEM-ACTIONS`

## Phase 5 — Interaction, inventory, UI

Scope: block breaking (server-auth crack progress overlay), placement, item use via
`InventoryTransaction`/`ItemStackRequest`; hotbar + survival/creative inventory + containers
(chest/furnace/crafting UIs); forms (modal/menu/custom JSON forms — Lunar's ClickUI depends on
these); chat with Bedrock formatting codes; HUD (health/hunger/armor/air, bossbar, scoreboard,
title/actionbar); Bedrock bitmap font rendering from pack `font/` assets. Taste bar applies:
UI phases get fable-5/opus-4.8 review before merge.

**Phase 5 roadmap (kept current as work lands):**

**Approved gameplay-HUD presentation deviation (expanded 2026-07-19):** the
in-game HUD may use the pinned Java Edition 26.2 presentation for chat, hotbar,
scoreboard, hearts, hunger, armor, air, experience/level, and applicable
mount/offhand/effect/attack-indicator surfaces. Bedrock remains authoritative
for packets, attributes, equipment, inventory, game mode, combat timing, and
reconciliation; Java presentation must not invent state that Bedrock does not
expose. Menus, inventories, containers, forms, controls, and resource-pack JSON
UI remain Bedrock/resource-pack-driven. The current text/panel renderer is an
incomplete scaffold until the full state matrix and native/live comparison gates
below are green. See `AGENTS.md`'s gameplay-HUD exception for the repository-wide
scope and decompilation-evidence rules.

**Bounded native HUD tranche (2026-07-19):** the protocol-1001 carrier and
retained presentation now provide provenance-pinned health, hunger, armor, air,
hotbar, selected-slot, chat, and scoreboard data paths. Survival geometry is
bottom-centered across the tested Windows window sizes, uses the pinned
`hud_screen.json` cap alpha, and fails closed when the carrier is absent or the
viewport cannot contain the fixed-scale bar. This does not complete Phase 5:
automatic vanilla GUI-scale selection is still unimplemented (the owned
Windows classic profile remains pinned to logical scale 2), nonstandard
attribute maxima remain hidden until stacked/compressed-row authority is
implemented, held item stacks are not drawn in the hotbar, and scoreboard/boss
surfaces remain fail-closed until their full native authority is owned. The
normal/maximized native WGC comparison and live third-party checks remain part
of the 5.7 gate.

**Official sample authority and unified build closure (2026-07-19):** the
pinned Mojang `bedrock-samples-v1.26.30.32-preview-full.zip` contains the exact
25 HUD PNG byte sequences used by the bounded carrier plus the five reviewed UI
authority JSON files. `make client` now depends on the single `assets` umbrella:
it reacquires and verifies a missing extracted sample pack once, builds the
world, atmosphere, entity/animation, open-font, and HUD carriers and reports,
verifies physics assets, and launches only after every prerequisite succeeds.
The generated Mojang payloads remain ignored local data. The same audit confirms
that inventory/container/menu references, 1,612 compiled item visual routes,
entity rigs and animation payloads, particles, and most sound effects are
source-unblocked; their UI screens, held/viewmodel/dropped-item rendering,
animation evaluation, particle renderer, and audio runtime remain implementation
work and are not closed by asset availability. Base Latin Mojangles, 185 sound
binaries, and block-render model JSON remain absent from the official sample
archive.

**Approved Java-style gameplay HUD contract (2026-07-19):** the clean-room
visual reference is Minecraft Java Edition 26.2 with default resources on
Windows 11. Acceptance covers survival, creative, and spectator; normal,
damaged, absorption, poisoned, withered, and frozen hearts; normal/depleted
hunger; air; XP/level; armor present/absent; mount health/jump; main/offhand;
attack indicator; selected-item label; effects; and scoreboard/chat overlap.
The armor row appears above hearts only while authoritative equipped armor is
nonzero. Capture GUI scales 2, 3, 4, and Auto at 1280x720, 1920x1080, and
2560x1440 with 100% and 150% desktop scaling where applicable, then validate
equivalent logical layout and safe areas on supported macOS Retina output.
Decompiled proprietary Java source must not be copied, translated, vendored, or
used as implementation code; independently implement only observable behavior
from a legally obtained running client or other approved references.

Delivered so far: Java-style scoreboard/chat presentation, centered hotbar
selection, local number-key/wheel/controller slot prediction with outbound
`MobEquipment`, experience attribute retention, and XP bar/level presentation.
Still incomplete: hotbar item icons/counts/durability, authoritative selected
stack, armor derivation and conditional row, nonstandard maxima, full state
matrix, GUI scaling/safe areas, and native/live comparison. Java chat fade-out
remains pending measured timing.

- [ ] **5.1 Bedrock UI foundation.** `P5.1-UI` Create `crates/ui`, ingest the pinned pack's bitmap
  fonts/glyph metrics, implement bounded formatting-code-aware text layout, UI scaling/safe
  areas, focus/navigation, mouse/touch/controller input, and a shared retained draw pipeline.
  Prove no per-glyph mesh/material churn and exact cross-platform DPI behavior.
- [ ] **5.2 Receive-only server text and HUD state.** `P5.2-HUD` Normalize bounded `Text`, title,
  actionbar, toast, player-status, health/hunger/armor/air, and related lifecycle packets into
  vendor-neutral stores. Render chat history, title/actionbar, and the survival HUD without
  permitting UI focus to leak movement input.
- [ ] **5.3 Interactive chat.** `P5.3-CHAT` Add chat focus/history/autocomplete, Bedrock formatting,
  bounded UTF-8 editing and clipboard behavior, then send through the Go core with session/FIFO
  identity and spam-safe rate limits. Verify third-party server receive/send and disconnect
  behavior.
- [ ] **5.4 Scoreboard and boss bars.** `P5.4-SCOREBOARD` Normalize objective/display/score and boss-event
  create/update/remove packets into independent bounded lifecycle stores. Render sidebar/list/
  below-name objectives, score ordering, boss health/style/count stacking, and title/actionbar
  coexistence with deterministic replacement/removal tests.
- [ ] **5.5 Interaction, hotbar, and inventory.** `P5.5-INTERACTION-COMBAT-INVENTORY` Implement server-authoritative break cracks,
  placement/use, selected slot, item stack/network-ID reconciliation, creative/survival
  inventory, and chest/furnace/crafting containers with rollback on rejected stack requests.

Entity combat is part of this tranche and is strictly vanilla:

- sample one immutable local eye/look pose, selected stack, actor snapshot,
  and collision/world identity for each attack decision;
- ray-test against reviewed combat bounding boxes, choose the nearest valid
  intercept deterministically, and reject an entity when a nearer solid block
  occludes the path;
- apply native game-mode reach and interaction rules established by matching
  Bedrock evidence; never add reach fluctuation, extended distance, target
  enlargement, automatic targeting, or Lunar-specific behaviour;
- on a valid attack, emit the protocol-1001
  `InventoryTransaction`/`UseItemOnEntityActionAttack` contract with the exact
  target runtime ID, selected slot/item, player position, session identity, and
  FIFO ordering required by the server;
- on a miss, present only the native missed-swing behaviour and do not invent a
  target transaction;
- keep damage, death, knockback, durability, cooldown, inventory mutation, and
  target validity server-authoritative while allowing bounded provisional
  swing/hit presentation where native behaviour does;
- rate-limit only malformed, duplicated, or queue-overflowing input; do not
  turn one physical click into an auto-clicker or impose non-native combat
  timing.

Combat fixtures cover nearest-hit ordering, overlapping boxes, inside-box
starts, pose-dependent bounds, block occlusion, unloaded boundaries, stale or
removed runtime IDs, server-declared non-attackable state, game-mode reach,
miss behaviour, selected-item changes, session replacement,
backpressure, and exact attack encoding. Local BDS and authenticated
third-party witnesses correlate click, ray snapshot, target decision,
transaction, server response, actor/inventory revisions, swing/hurt pose, and
presented frame. No Lunar module is enabled, queried, or required for these
gates.

- [ ] **5.6 Server forms.** `P5.6-FORMS` Implement modal/menu/custom JSON forms, validation, cancellation,
  keyboard/controller/touch navigation, and response routing. This is the prerequisite for
  Lunar ClickUI compatibility.
- [ ] **5.7 UI parity and performance acceptance.** `P5.7-PARITY-PERF` Compare matching vanilla reference views at
  supported scales/aspect ratios, test keyboard/mouse/controller/touch focus transitions, and
  prove bounded retained memory plus stable frame time with chat, scoreboard, boss bars,
  inventory, and forms active together.

- [ ] **5.8 In-game menu, controls, video settings, and persistence.** `P5.8-SETTINGS`

## Phase 6 — Online product surface

Scope: main menu + settings (video/controls/audio/account); server browser (saved servers);
Realms and friends lists in-UI (control-channel data from Phase 1) with one-click join;
transfer/reconnect UX; **server resource packs applied at runtime** (cache from core →
`crates/assets` hot-swaps textures/models/sounds/lang over the vanilla base — the asset
system from Phase 2 must have been built pack-stack-aware); disconnect screens with real
reasons; auth/device-code UX polish. Optional stretch: Lunar module toggles surfaced in-client
via control channel (v1.x, not v1).

## Phase 7 — Local worlds on dragonfly

Scope: core embeds/spawns dragonfly (`platform/pc-server` and dragonfly-server skill patterns
as reference); world create/select/delete UI; settings (name, gamemode, seed, flat/normal);
LevelDB world persistence via dragonfly; pause/resume semantics on window focus; same client
path as online (core points the game socket at the local dragonfly). Documented v1 limits:
dragonfly's generation and mob AI parity gaps are accepted, not chased.

## Phase 8 — Audio, polish, packaging

Scope: audio via bevy_audio/kira — sound events mapped through `sound_definitions.json`,
positional sounds, music/ambient (asset-availability audit from Phase 2 decides
bedrock-samples vs. client-assets-import); performance hardening pass against budgets;
macOS .app + codesign/notarize, Windows installer, Linux AppImage; core binary bundled and
lifecycle-managed by the app; crash reporting (sentry for Rust + core); auto-update channel;
first-run experience.

**Final Go relay/batching polish:** adopt the batch-boundary API from
[`HashimTheArab/gophertunnel` PR #80](https://github.com/HashimTheArab/gophertunnel/pull/80)
after it lands on the pinned `lunar` line. The integration commit must retain the pinned
`Conn.Abort` work as well as the PR's batch API. Enable `Dialer.EnableBatchReading` and
`ListenConfig.EnableBatchReading` on the two core legs, replace the relay's single-packet
`ReadPacket` pumps with `ReadBatch`, and forward each returned slice as exactly one downstream
batch using `WritePacketImmediate(batch...)` (or a tested `WritePacket` + single `Flush`
equivalent that preserves buffered ordering). Never mix `ReadBatch` with
`ReadPacket`/`ReadBytes`/`Read` on a batch-reading connection. Port the PR's
ordering, slow-reader, mid-batch decode-error, deferred-login-boundary, and pre-disconnect flush
regressions into `core/internal/relay`; retain bounded lossless backpressure and verify that the
change improves batching without regressing join latency, memory, or shutdown behavior.
The PR #80 API is now carried on the published `cinnabar` fork branch, and the core is
pinned to its exact commit `48765b0f2652229b0fa8d58909bb07a2795cc117`; Cinnabar enables batch reading on both legs,
preserves source batch boundaries, and retains the exact 1,600-packet split ceiling. Core
now forwards each bounded slice with `WritePacketImmediate`, pre-flushes existing buffered
output, tests boundaries in both directions, and prevents the initial loading-screen filter
from merging adjacent source wire batches. A live 1.26.33.1 BDS regression then proved that
Rust's duplicate no-ID loading-screen Start/End may occupy two adjacent local batches; the
bounded filter now holds at most one Start through the next read, drops only the exact initial
pair, and flushes a mismatch or EOF in its original batch before current traffic. Full core
tests, independent review, and a successful native BDS join are green through `a6c1ffc`.
Porting the
remaining PR-specific slow-reader/decode-error/disconnect regressions and completing the
join-latency/resource comparison remain open, so this final polish item is not yet complete.

## Sequencing and program rules

- Order is 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → (4 ∥ 5) → 6 → 7 → 8. Phases 4 and 5 can run in parallel worktrees once 3 lands (disjoint crates; both consume `crates/world` + `crates/protocol` which are stable by then).
- Each phase starts by converting its scope block into a full task-by-task plan (superpowers:writing-plans), gets brainstorm-level review if its scope shifted, and ends with the requesting-code-review flow. PR-bot adjudication rules apply throughout.
- Every phase must leave `main` in a runnable state (`app` launches, joins BDS, does everything prior phases delivered) — CI runs the Phase 0 acceptance connect as a smoke test forever.
- Protocol bumps during the program: deliberate, one task, lockstep — regenerate valentine defs, run conformance, bump core, bump `registrygen` exports, fix findings. Never mid-phase.

## v1 Definition of Done

From a clean machine: install → sign in with Xbox (device code) → join a third-party RakNet
server, a Realm, and a friend's world (NetherNet) → play survival basics (move, build, mine,
chest, craft, chat, forms) with vanilla look and feel at 60fps on the dev MacBook → create a
local dragonfly world, play it offline, reload it. Server resource packs render. No Rust-side
auth/transport code exists.

## Appendix: Rendering Performance Playbook (binding for Phases 0 and 2)

FPS and memory in this client are dominated by chunk meshes; these techniques stack
multiplicatively and are the required approach, not suggestions:

1. **Paletted chunk data stays paletted at runtime.** Mesh directly from palette + packed
   indices; never expand to flat per-block arrays (the naeast2 lesson, client-side). Uniform
   subchunks (all air/all one block) store one palette entry and skip meshing entirely.
2. **Binary greedy meshing.** Per-axis-column `u64` bitmasks; face culling and coplanar
   merging via bitwise ops (target: tens of µs per subchunk, making remesh-on-update ~free).
   Merges split where baked AO/light values differ. References: `block-mesh` crate and
   TanTanDev binary-greedy-meshing demos.
3. **Packed vertices / per-quad vertex pulling.** Local position 5+5+5 bits, face ID 3 bits
   (normal from LUT), texture-array layer index, AO 2 bits, light 8 bits → 1–2 `u32` per
   vertex, subchunk origin as a per-draw push constant. Preferred form: one ~8-byte record
   per quad in a storage buffer, corners reconstructed in the vertex shader, and one shared
   static index buffer for all chunks. This targets roughly 20–40× less mesh memory than
   naive 32-byte vertices.
4. **Custom Bevy render phase for chunks.** No per-subchunk `Mesh`/`StandardMaterial`; use
   one chunk pipeline family with at most two immutable state variants
   (opaque/cutout with depth writes, blend without depth writes) and one shared bind group,
   with `multi_draw_indirect` where available.
5. **Visibility culling.** Per-subchunk frustum culling + cave/connectivity culling
   (Checchi-style: face-to-face connectivity flood-filled at mesh time, then BFS from the
   camera through the chunk graph—the approach used by vanilla).
6. **Budget spiky work.** Decode/mesh/light only on Rayon workers; GPU uploads capped per
   frame and nearest-first; light updates deduplicated and queued; block + sky light baked
   per vertex at mesh time so lighting cost rides the remesh budget.
7. **2D texture arrays, not a stitched atlas.** This avoids mip bleeding, permits greedy-quad
   UV wrapping, and implements flipbooks as layer swaps; mipmaps are generated per layer.
   Use one measured physical array when the reachable deduplicated layer inventory fits the
   minimum target adapter, otherwise at most two equal-format array pages in the same shared
   bind group. More pages, frame dropping, or silent animation degradation are forbidden.

Explicitly deferred past v1: distant-chunk LODs (not needed at a 16-chunk radius), GPU
occlusion queries (cave culling suffices), and mesh shaders.

Resource budget (tracked from Phase 2 onward; reference machine class = Ryzen 5 3600 / mid
Apple Silicon, 16-chunk radius, capped 60fps): combined RSS (client + core) ≤ 650MB
steady-state; steady-state CPU ≤ 15% total; join/teleport bursts may saturate cores but must
settle within ~2 seconds. Baseline for comparison: vanilla Bedrock client on the same
machine runs at 800MB–2GB and 30%+ CPU.

Binding Phase 2 scope: block registry + block-state → model/texture mapping (generated
export from Dragonfly's registry via `tools/registrygen`, shipped as a binary asset, with
pinned PMMP BedrockData as the exact protocol-1001 canonical palette/property/biome
cross-check, Axolotl Valentine's typed state catalog as a versioned selector reference, and
Axolotl's exact pinned PrismarineJS Bedrock collision shapes as reviewed cuboid-template and
occlusion inputs rather than render/UV authority); vanilla
asset ingestion from **Mojang/bedrock-samples** pinned to the matching game version
(terrain textures, `blocks.json`, flipbooks, and biome colors). The pinned samples have no
block-render model JSON, so deterministic reviewed family generators combine collision
bounds, Dragonfly behavior rules, Mojang texture mappings, and vanilla-reference evidence.
Zuri is not a rendering or asset-system input. BDS
`resource_packs/vanilla` is server-minimal (`blocks.json` + texts only): it is a data
reference, not the texture source. Use the bounded one-or-two-page 2D texture-array scheme
above with per-layer mipmaps; meshing per
this playbook with opaque/cutout/blend layers; a client-side block + sky flood-fill light
engine with per-vertex light baked at mesh time and day/night; biome tinting for
grass/foliage/water; sky, fog, and clouds; chunk streaming/eviction tied to
`ChunkRadiusUpdated` + `SubChunk` request flow. Custom block-entity renderers remain
deferred; chests/signs receive static models in this phase. The Phase 0 performance budget
carries forward, with full remesh of view distance after teleport ≤ 2 seconds.
