# Phase 2 Block-Family Inventory

Date: 2026-07-11

This is the reproducible planning baseline for Phase 2.6 family generators. It
classifies every protocol-1001 canonical block name and state without treating
collision boxes as visible geometry or UV authority. It contains no Mojang pack
payload.

## Inputs and method

The audit used these pinned inputs:

- PMMP BedrockData `bdb44a48fb6beffb6e9f6864f06d2232eb62b6a3`
  (`6.7.0+bedrock-1.26.30`), including the exact 1,356-name/16,913-state
  protocol-1001 palette;
- PrismarineJS minecraft-data
  `6ec59288287e4045331eaa47ee8fb104278f6b98`, including
  `blockStates.json`, `blocks.json`, and `blockCollisionShapes.json`;
- Dragonfly `b85c56ffea6b306798a935f14cc941c76618be52`;
- Axolotl Stack `6f6806e821a579c183c44d786f76d9b358a2b825`
  and its Valentine overlap catalog; and
- the locally acquired, ignored Mojang 1.26.30 sample resource pack described
  by `assets/vanilla-source.json`.

The current audited `BREG1003` export is 4,692,247 bytes with SHA-256
`23a504f0daa248c717249d0aa247362933ff963754aedd790566fc0516cdcf95`.
It decoded exactly to EOF and reported 1,356 names, 16,913 states, 1,321
Valentine names, 15,845 Valentine states, and attributable gaps of 35 names and
1,068 states. The 2026-07-13 selector-only regeneration preserves
`redstone_signal` as a typed pressed flag for exactly the 256 pressure-plate
records. The 2026-07-14 regenerations additionally assign the dedicated
chiseled-bookshelf family and reviewed solid/full-face facts to exactly IDs
1,605–1,860, then the dedicated empty-collision resin-clump family to exactly
IDs 2,930–2,993. Two resin generations were byte-identical.

The 2026-07-14 selector-alias regeneration then promotes exactly 27 reviewed
compatibility states across hay, bone, quartz variants, purpur, and TNT; two
generations were byte-identical.

The subsequent cactus regeneration classifies exactly the 16 canonical
`minecraft:cactus` ages as reviewed cuboids while preserving empty flags and
face coverage, Growth-only state, and shape-84 collision evidence. Two
generations were byte-identical.

## Phase 3 physics-registry derivative

The Phase 3 `PREG1001` carrier is a deterministic, local-only derivative of
this same exact `BREG1003` state order. Collision boxes retain the pinned
Prismarine fixed-point join; ordinary and special movement facts are explicit
for every state and reviewed against the pinned PMMP/Dragonfly catalog. The
compiler rejects gaps, extras, duplicate identities, contradictory fluids,
unknown responses, invalid scalars, and malformed compound boxes. Only
`crates/assets/data/block-physics-v1001.sha256` is published; both generated
carrier copies remain ignored under `.local`.

The special-movement join is an explicit strictly sorted reviewed table rather
than a permissive name switch. Production generation verifies the exact PMMP
friction-file hash, all three exact Prismarine behavior/state/shape hashes, and
the pinned Dragonfly build dependency. Each reviewed family is cross-checked
against its exact canonical state count, Prismarine bounding-box class, and
Dragonfly registered implementation-type set. This includes all 78
`cave_vines`, `cave_vines_body_with_berries`, and
`cave_vines_head_with_berries` states as climbable. Bubble `drag_down` is a
required unique typed byte fact; missing, duplicate, malformed, unknown, or
out-of-range facts abort generation.

The inventory parser decoded every bounded `BREG1003` record, grouped records
by canonical name, and joined each name's Prismarine state-ordered collision
shape IDs. It counted typed property domains, empty/unit/multi-box topology,
and direct Mojang `blocks.json` name coverage. The initial comment line in
Mojang reference JSON was excluded before JSON decoding. Counts below must be
regenerated when any pin or registry schema changes.

## FlowerBed normal-state baseline

`minecraft:wildflowers` and `minecraft:pink_petals` now compile Growth 0-3 as
one through four immutable additive ground-patch groups for every preserved
cardinal value: South=0, West=1, North=2, East=3. Each terrain key must expose
exactly the routed flower material at array index 0 and stem material at index
1 in an exact two-entry array; a dedicated terrain accessor rejects static,
missing, and overlong arrays independently of which registry states are being
compiled. The template key contains both material IDs, growth, and orientation.
Growth 4-7 is still an explicit attributable diagnostic and is never clamped,
wrapped, or aliased.

## Vine attachment baseline

All 16 protocol-1001 `minecraft:vine` states use a dedicated static model
family. The pinned Dragonfly `Vines.EncodeBlock` implementation is the geometry
selector authority: `vine_direction_bits` maps bit 0 to south, bit 1 to west,
bit 2 to north, and bit 3 to east. Dragonfly exposes attachments only for those
four horizontal directions, while the pinned Mojang `blocks.json` entry supplies
the single `vine` terrain key and no additional geometry or top-face selector.
The compiler therefore emits one two-sided, alpha-cutout, foliage-tinted wall
plane for each set bit and does not synthesize an upward/downward plane from
unencoded neighbour state. The zero mask remains a non-diagnostic zero-quad
model. Every plane is inset by 1/256 block to avoid support-surface z-fighting,
has no support-face cull flag, and contributes no cube geometry, full-face
coverage, or full-block occlusion.

The compact coordinates and UVs are a geometry baseline derived from the four
Mojang Java `flowerbed_1.json` through `flowerbed_4.json` models in the pinned
`MrHakan/mc-mapping-tree` commit
`be56c80939e94f4afd5e63bc40c684af9ff218fb`. Source element coordinates were
rotated as declared by those models, quantized once to the existing 1/256-block
position format, and retain 1/4096 texture-tile UVs. The resulting additive
prefixes contain 7, 10, 17, and 20 two-sided quads, respectively, with all
vertices below 64/256 block height. The pinned `wildflowers.json` blockstate
defines the table as a North-facing baseline: North is identity, East rotates
90 degrees, South 180 degrees, and West 270 degrees. These map to preserved
Bedrock values North=2, East=3, South=0, and West=1. In the packed `(x,z)`
coordinate convention, East=90 is `(256-z,x)` and West=270 is `(z,256-x)`.
This Java-derived table is provisional geometry evidence only; Task 4's pinned
native Bedrock gallery remains the authority for final coordinates, UV
orientation, and command-only Growth 4-7 semantics.

## Exhaustive renderer-work partition

The cube row is deliberately conservative. It assigns all states of a name
with at least one Dragonfly `Solid` state, then removes the known visible
non-unit exceptions described below. Unresolved names stay in the residual;
none are omitted.

| Renderer family | Names | States | Shapes | Empty | Unit cube | Multi-box |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Air/invisible/engine-only | 25 | 36 | 2 | 33 | 3 | 0 |
| Cube, Dragonfly-backed after audited exceptions | 366 | 676 | 1 | 0 | 676 | 0 |
| Leaves | 11 | 44 | 1 | 0 | 44 | 0 |
| Cross plants | 60 | 256 | 1 | 256 | 0 | 0 |
| Crops | 11 | 176 | 15 | 156 | 0 | 0 |
| Aquatic cross/fans | 32 | 99 | 1 | 99 | 0 | 0 |
| Liquid | 4 | 64 | 1 | 64 | 0 | 0 |
| Slab | 136 | 272 | 3 | 0 | 136 | 0 |
| Stair | 64 | 512 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 512 |
| Door | 21 | 672 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Trapdoor | 21 | 336 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Pane/bars | 43 | 43 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Fence | 13 | 13 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Fence gate | 12 | 192 | 3 | 96 | 0 | 0 |
| Wall | 32 | 5,184 | 18 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Rail | 4 | 46 | 1 | 46 | 0 | 0 |
| Torch | 10 | 60 | 1 | 60 | 0 | 0 |
| Button/lever/pressure plate | 31 | 440 | 1 | 440 | 0 | 0 |
| Chest | 11 | 44 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Sign | 36 | 4,872 | 3 | 2,568 | 0 | 0 |
| Bed | 1 | 16 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Other template/residual | 412 | 2,860 | 119 | 582 | 812 | 54 |
| **Total** | **1,356** | **16,913** | | **4,400 globally** | | |

Walls and signs alone cover 10,056 states. Their cardinality reflects selector
products, not 10,056 distinct hand-authored models.

Fence-gate rendering is complete for all 192 states. The collision row's 96
open/empty values describe collision only, not visible geometry: exact vanilla
open gates still contain 40 render quads. Cinnabar therefore represents each
gate as a bounded two-template compound (24+16 quads, or 22+16 for closed
bamboo), preserving the existing 32-bit visibility mask and packed-reference
format without truncating the model.

Carpet rendering is complete for all 179 states. Seventeen ordinary carpets use
one exact 1/16-block cuboid route. Pale moss contributes the other 162 states as
the complete four-side ternary matrix plus upper bit; its opaque base and
two-sided cutout side planes remain separate material classes, including the
isolated-upper base-plus-four-tall form.

Button rendering is complete for all 168 states. Fourteen materials share an
exact pressed/unpressed cuboid family across six outward faces; wall instances
use target-space UV locking with independent literal goldens, while floor and
ceiling keep their deterministic canonical yaw. These partial models remain
non-occluding and cave-connectivity-open.

## Selector requirements

The generated selector representation or the preserved canonical typed state
must cover at least:

- liquid depth: 16 values;
- slab vertical half, with double slabs represented by separate names;
- stair direction (4) and upside-down bit;
- door cardinal direction (4), hinge, open, and upper-half bits;
- trapdoor direction (4), open, and upside-down bits;
- gate cardinal direction, in-wall bit, and open bit;
- four wall connection heights (`none`, `short`, `tall`) and wall-post bit;
- rail direction (10) and rail-data bit;
- torch facing (`unknown`, west, east, north, south, top);
- button facing and pressed bit, eight-valued lever direction, and weighted
  plate signal 0-15;
- standing-sign rotation (16), wall facing, hanging, and attached bits;
- bed direction, head/foot, and occupied bits;
- vegetation ages up to 26, upper-half/tip/hanging/propagule selectors;
- crop growth, including oriented cocoa pod geometry; and
- kelp age, three seagrass variants, coral direction, and fan direction.

The original seven-field `ModelState` is not enough by itself. In particular,
it does not represent namespaced cardinal direction, torch and rail direction,
button/lever state, wall heights/post, sign attachment, bed head/occupied,
door upper-half, or gate in-wall. Family generators must either receive an
expanded typed schema or decode the preserved canonical typed state.

## Collision evidence

Prismarine supplies 342 reusable collision shapes: 12,513 non-empty states,
4,400 empty states, 23 multi-box shape definitions, and at most seven boxes.

- Slabs provide lower, upper, and full shapes.
- Stairs provide eight two-box shapes.
- Trapdoors provide six useful oriented/open shapes.
- Gates provide three shapes; 96 open states are empty.
- Walls provide 18 shapes but simplify every state to one bounding box.
- Doors, fences, panes/bars, chests, and beds each collapse to one simplified
  shape.
- Controls, rails, torches, crossed plants, aquatic plants, and liquids have
  empty collision.

This supports slab/stair bounds and conservative occlusion. It cannot supply
visible walls, fences, panes, chests, signs, controls, plants, or their UVs.

## Classifier pitfalls

Known false positives:

- `_flower` classifies `chorus_flower` as a cross, but it is a cuboid cluster.
- Dragonfly `model.Solid` marks 34 visible non-unit states as cubes: eight
  copper-golem-statue material names with four states each, plus `soul_sand`
  and `mud`.
- `cocoa` belongs to the growth/crop domain but needs an oriented pod template,
  not crossed crop quads.

Known false negatives:

- `iron_bars` and eight copper-bar names are missed by a pane-only suffix rule;
- all walls (32 names/5,184 states), controls (31/440), rails (4/46), torches
  (10/60), and the bed (1/16) are otherwise left unknown;
- `colored_torch_*` does not end in `_torch`;
- most modern flower names do not end in `_flower`; and
- melon and pumpkin stems are absent from the original crop allowlist.

Flags-only cube promotion also strands 43 cube states inside 23 names whose
sibling states are already cubes: one state in each of 16 glazed-terracotta
names, nine states each in `bone_block` and `hay_block`, two states each in
`quartz_block`, `chiseled_quartz_block`, `smooth_quartz`, and `purpur_block`,
and one state in `tnt`. Render family is a name/family decision; occlusion
confidence may remain state-specific.

## Residual topology

The 2026-07-14 chiseled-bookshelf tranche removes exactly the contiguous 256
canonical states at IDs 1,605–1,860. The dedicated family admits only the full
`books_stored:int 0..63 × direction:int 0..3` product with canonical ID formula,
unit collision, solid/full-face facts, exact face routing, a two-entry front
terrain array, and static side/top terrain entries. It compiles four opaque
source materials and 64 eleven-quad templates. Native evidence and hashes are
recorded in `docs/evidence/phase-2-chiseled-bookshelf-native-reference.md`.

The subsequent resin-clump tranche removes exactly the contiguous 64 canonical
states at IDs 2,930–2,993. Admission requires the complete typed
`multi_face_direction_bits:int 0..63` product, `id = 2930 + mask`, empty flags
and face coverage, shape 0 with no collision boxes, and the exact scalar/static
`resin_clump` terrain route. Native 1.26.33.1 evidence maps bits to
down/up/south/west/north/east, matches the glow-lichen face-relative UV table,
and normalizes a written zero mask to 63; the compiler therefore aliases mask 0
to the all-face template. One static alpha-cutout material produces 63 immutable
templates and 192 quads. Evidence and local-only screenshot hashes are recorded
in `docs/evidence/phase-2-resin-clump-native-reference.md`.

The subsequent selector-alias opaque-cube tranche removes exactly 27 states:
IDs 2,908-2,910, 2,912-2,914, 2,916-2,918, 5,443-5,444, 6,466-6,468,
6,470-6,472, 6,474-6,476, 7,082-7,083, 13,113, 14,686-14,687, and
15,345-15,346. Admission binds all 38 states in the seven complete products,
exact typed selectors and formula IDs, unit collision, exact static non-tinted
opaque pack routes, and the native X/Y/Z cap permutation. `deprecated` and
`explode_bit` remain static visual aliases. The runtime emits only ordinary cube
faces, with quarter-turn UV flags on the four non-cap faces for X/Z pillars.
Commands and local-only evidence hashes are recorded in
`docs/evidence/phase-2-selector-alias-cubes-native-reference.md`.

The subsequent cactus tranche removes exactly IDs 13,606-13,621. Admission
requires the complete `age:int 0..15` product, formula `id = 13606 + age`,
Primary/Cuboid ownership, empty flags and face coverage, exact shape-84
collision, the exact side/down/up static pack route, and native-confirmed
`[16,0,16]..[240,256,240]` bounds. Every age shares one six-quad template and
three static alpha-cutout materials. Sequential/hash, all-boundary, water,
cave-open, and dense 4,096-reference/24,576-draw-light tests are green.
Commands and local-only evidence hashes are recorded in
`docs/evidence/phase-2-cactus-native-reference.md`.

The subsequent cake tranche removes exactly IDs 14,055-14,061. Admission
requires the complete `bite_counter:int 0..6` product, formula
`id = 14055 + bite_counter`, Primary/Cuboid ownership, empty flags/coverage,
exact shapes 89-95 and bounds, four literal untinted two-entry terrain routes,
and the native-confirmed west cut direction. Seven immutable six-quad templates
use bounds `[16+32*b,0,16]..[240,128,240]`; only bitten west faces select
`cake_inner`. Sequential/hash, all-boundary, water, cave-open, and dense
4,096-reference/24,576-draw-light tests are green. Commands and local-only
evidence hashes are recorded in
`docs/evidence/phase-2-cake-native-reference.md`.

The subsequent farmland tranche removes exactly IDs 6,122-6,129. Admission
requires the complete `moisturized_amount:int 0..7` product, formula
`id = 6122 + moisturized_amount`, Primary/Cuboid ownership, empty
flags/coverage, exact shape-43 collision, and literal untinted static side plus
two-entry top routes. Native binds amount zero to dry terrain index 1 and every
nonzero amount to wet index 0. Two immutable templates use bounds
`[0,0,0]..[256,240,256]`; sequential/hash, all-boundary, water, cave-open, and
uniform/mixed dense 4,096-reference/24,576-draw-light tests are green. Commands
and local-only evidence hashes are recorded in
`docs/evidence/phase-2-farmland-native-reference.md`.

The current exact residual is 2,448 diagnostics including air; no unrelated ID
changed status.

The original 412-name/2,860-state planning residual was bounded and
attributable:

- 229 names/812 states have full-cube collision. This is only a candidate set:
  it also contains shulker boxes, pistons, chorus flower, azalea, Education
  workstations, spawners, and other visible exceptions.
- 23 names/477 states have entirely empty collision: ground overlays, powder
  snow, portals/gateway, vines/lichen/sculk vein, item frames, banners,
  redstone/tripwire, scaffolding, sea pickle, small dripleaf, frog spawn,
  spore blossom, and related plants.
- Five names/58 states use multi-box collision: `composter`,
  `end_portal_frame`, `hopper`, `cauldron`, and `brewing_stand`.
- 155 names/1,513 states use partial or mixed single boxes. Reusable groups
  include carpets, candles/cakes, anvils, heads, shelves, chains/lanterns/rods,
  amethyst buds, copper-golem statues, farmland/path/snow, campfires, ladders,
  cactus, pots, workstations, eggs, chorus, sculk sensors, redstone devices,
  bell, and conduit.

Dragonfly already exposes useful behavioral/bounding semantics for many of
these groups. Those semantics are procedural inputs, not render geometry or UV
authority.

## Mojang mapping gaps

The pinned pack has 1,231 real `blocks.json` entries and 1,300 terrain keys.
Direct canonical-name lookup covers 1,181 names; 175 require aliases, special
handling, or sourced engine-only treatment:

- 146 residual names, dominated by 119 Education `element_*` names and
  Education workstations/hard-glass blocks;
- 17 hard-glass pane names;
- five colored/underwater torch names;
- five engine-only names without block entries; and
- `grass_block` and `sea_lantern`, which are ordinary alias cases.

Hard glass can reuse reviewed glass/stained-glass aliases. The standard sample
pack has no direct terrain keys for Education elements, underwater TNT,
colored/underwater torches, chemical heat, or material reducer. Zero-diagnostic
coverage needs explicit reviewed aliases or sourced engine-only handling; it
cannot be inferred from collision or `blocks.json`.

## High-impact implementation order

1. Liquids and flipbook animation.
2. Terrestrial/aquatic crossed vegetation and crops.
3. Slabs and stairs.
4. Walls (5,184 states from one connection-aware generator).
5. Signs (4,872 states from a small geometry set).
6. Doors and trapdoors.
7. Controls, rails, and torches.
8. Panes/bars, fences, and gates.
9. Reusable residual templates and individually reviewed full-cube candidates.
