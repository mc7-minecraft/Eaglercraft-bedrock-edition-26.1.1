# Phase 2 cactus native reference

Date: 2026-07-14

Protocol: 1001

Native version: Bedrock 1.26.33.1

No Mojang assets or screenshots are tracked by this manifest.

## Native result

- Random tick speed was set to zero.
- `/setblock` wrote every exact `age:int` value 0 through 15 on isolated sand.
- An exact one-block `/fill ... air replace cactus ["age"=N]` probe returned
  one replaced block for every age, after which each block was restored.
- All ages use identical rendering.
- Native visible bounds are X/Z `1/16..15/16` and Y `0..1`.
- West/east/north/south use `cactus_side`, down uses `cactus_bottom`, and up
  uses `cactus_top`. The visible one-pixel side inset is represented by source
  U columns 1 through 14 in the compiler's independently tested mapping.
- One-, two-, and three-block stacks are full height without an air seam.
- Cactus is alpha cutout, not full-face occluding, and does not neighbour-cull
  its inset faces against opaque blocks.

## Reproducible fixture

The fresh deterministic fixture uses the following exact layout string:

```text
platform:y=191;x=160..184;z=52..78;fill=black_concrete;west:x=160:red_concrete;east:x=184:blue_concrete;north:z=52:green_concrete;south:z=78:yellow_concrete;cactus[a]:x=166+4*(a%4);y=193;z=58+4*floor(a/4);support:sand@y192;a=0..15;stacks:age=0;one:(164,193,54);two:(170,193..194,54);three:(176,193..195,54);stack_support:sand@y192;adjacency:cactus[age=0]@(180,193,74);support:sand@(180,192,74);east_neighbor:black_concrete@(181,193,74);probe:(180,193,76);probe_support:sand@(180,192,76)
```

Its UTF-8 SHA-256 is
`69e346bc5708a9b7548b3c79c27027718eba5ab312a6e20ae1eec9902a00289b`.
The colored borders make the four cardinal directions identifiable: west red,
east blue, north green, and south yellow.

The fixture was created with random ticks disabled and exact Bedrock commands:

```mcfunction
gamerule randomtickspeed 0
fill 160 191 52 184 191 78 black_concrete
fill 160 191 52 160 191 78 red_concrete
fill 184 191 52 184 191 78 blue_concrete
fill 160 191 52 184 191 52 green_concrete
fill 160 191 78 184 191 78 yellow_concrete
```

For each `a` from 0 through 15, the grid uses
`x = 166 + 4 * (a % 4)`, `z = 58 + 4 * floor(a / 4)`, sand at Y=192,
and this exact state at Y=193:

```mcfunction
setblock <x> 192 <z> sand
setblock <x> 193 <z> cactus ["age"=<a>]
```

The independent fixed-coordinate state probe at `(180,193,76)` was reset,
written, and read back for every age using:

```mcfunction
setblock 180 193 76 air
setblock 180 193 76 cactus ["age"=<a>]
fill 180 193 76 180 193 76 air replace cactus ["age"=<a>]
```

Every exact readback returned `1 blocks filled`. The opaque-neighbor fixture is
an age-zero cactus at `(180,193,74)` on sand with black concrete immediately to
its east at `(181,193,74)`. It was written with the exact commands below and
captured in two post-command views, including one after the overlay faded:

```mcfunction
setblock 180 192 74 sand
setblock 181 193 74 black_concrete
setblock 180 193 74 cactus ["age"=0]
```

Fresh one-, two-, and three-block age-zero stacks were built along the north
edge with these exact commands:

```mcfunction
setblock 164 192 54 sand
setblock 164 193 54 cactus ["age"=0]
setblock 170 192 54 sand
setblock 170 193 54 cactus ["age"=0]
setblock 170 194 54 cactus ["age"=0]
setblock 176 192 54 sand
setblock 176 193 54 cactus ["age"=0]
setblock 176 194 54 cactus ["age"=0]
setblock 176 195 54 cactus ["age"=0]
```

The corresponding reproducible camera commands are:

```mcfunction
# Updated fixture overview
tp @s 154 196 45 facing 172 193 66
# Stack front: all three heights and their internal seams
tp @s 170 195 47 facing 170 194 54
# Stack grazing: side continuity and full-height placement
tp @s 158 194 53 facing 170 194 54
# Top inset: close elevated view of the three-high stack's top plane
tp @s 176 198 50.5 facing 176 195.8 54
```

Two registry generations and two pinned-pack compilations were byte-identical.
The exact production ratchet removed only IDs 13,606 through 13,621 with zero
additions, reducing diagnostics from 2,479 to 2,463. The matching-view,
two-frame Cinnabar GPU witness remains open.
