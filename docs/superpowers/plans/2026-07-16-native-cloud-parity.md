# Native Legacy Cloud Parity Implementation Plan

> **Execution:** Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`, strict red-green-refactor TDD,
> one implementation task at a time, an independent review after each accepted tranche, and
> immediate pushes to `bedrock-mc/cinnabar:phase2-textures` without rewriting history.

**Goal:** Replace the rejected preview-source, fixed-grid, opaque cloud behavior with the
matching Bedrock 1.26.33.1 legacy cloud path while retaining compact immutable geometry.

**Design authority:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-native-cloud-parity-design.md`

## Global constraints

- Never commit Mojang assets, compiled local asset carriers, screenshots, or native binaries.
- Preserve the eight-byte packed cloud quad and one-draw/one-resource-family architecture.
- Do not guess native `mesh_size` or `grid_size` world semantics; calibrate them.
- No production behavior is added before a focused failing test demonstrates the gap.
- Mark `plan.md` complete only from recorded automated and live evidence.

### Task 1: Exact local cloud override and provenance

**Likely files:** `crates/assets/src/atmosphere.rs`, `crates/assets/src/bin/assetc.rs`,
`crates/assets/src/lib.rs`, `crates/assets/tests/atmosphere.rs`, `Makefile`,
`app/tests/assets.rs`.

- [x] Add failing tests for an explicit cloud override: exact accepted SHA/dimensions, wrong
  hash, wrong dimensions, oversized input, missing path, and unchanged pinned sun/moon inputs.
- [x] Add an options-based compiler interface and `assetc atmosphere --clouds-override PATH`.
  The override replaces only the cloud bytes, keeps the canonical logical source path, records
  independent hashes, and fails closed.
- [x] Thread a portable `CINNABAR_CLOUDS_PNG` Make variable into the atmosphere command without
  introducing a checked-in local path. Keep the existing no-override fixture path deterministic.
- [x] Verify focused assets tests, asset CLI tests, Make contract tests, formatting, and strict
  Clippy. Independently review and commit locally; the owning integration lane handles any push.
  Normal CI uses an internal injected validation policy and pinned-reader seam to cover accepted
  options behavior plus typed rejection with synthetic PNGs; an injected command compiler drives
  the parsed CLI override through encoding and report publication. The public API always supplies
  the exact native policy. The Make target conservatively rebuilds in both override and default
  modes so changing from a set override to an empty variable cannot retain stale clouds.

### Task 2: Native cloud configuration model

**Likely files:** `crates/render/src/cloud_mesh.rs`, `crates/render/src/cloud_render.rs`,
`crates/render/tests/cloud_mesh.rs`, `crates/render/tests/cloud_render.rs`.

- [ ] Add failing tests for Low/Medium/High/Ultra exact grid, mesh, distance, distance-control,
  and lighting records; default to High.
- [ ] Implement bounded `CloudQuality` and `CloudRenderConfig` without changing current coverage
  math or claiming unproven world-space semantics.
- [ ] Add a native calibration harness/report contract that records matching views and derived
  coverage semantics. It must fail if asked to publish an uncalibrated mapping.
- [ ] Verify focused render tests, formatting, strict Clippy, review, commit, and push.

### Task 3: Transparent depth-aware legacy material

**Likely files:** `crates/render/src/cloud_render.rs`, `crates/render/src/cloud.wgsl`,
`crates/render/tests/cloud_render.rs`, `crates/render/tests/atmosphere.rs`.

- [ ] Add failing tests proving the legacy cloud item uses the transparent world phase, alpha
  blend, deterministic transparent ordering, reversed-Z depth testing, and no color-pass depth
  writes. Retain Metal-compatible binding visibility checks.
- [ ] Move queue/draw integration from opaque to transparent without adding resources or draws.
- [ ] Emit bounded cloud alpha and retain terrain depth occlusion, fog, identity caching, and
  zero-record behavior.
- [ ] Verify render and client suites, WGSL/Naga validation, formatting, strict Clippy, review,
  commit, and push.

### Task 4: Directional lighting and exact weather response

**Likely files:** `crates/render/src/cloud.wgsl`, `crates/render/src/atmosphere.rs`,
`app/src/environment.rs`, focused shader/environment tests.

- [ ] Add failing shader/CPU tests for known sun directions and exact rain `[191,191,191]` /
  thunder `[30,30,30]` colours at `0.95` contribution.
- [ ] Replace fixed face multipliers with normal/directional diffuse lighting from the existing
  atmosphere frame, preserving bounded clear daylight, fog, and alpha ordering.
- [ ] Verify shader semantics on WGSL/Naga and Metal stage validation, full focused suites,
  formatting, strict Clippy, review, commit, and push.

### Task 5: Native coverage calibration and config-driven geometry

- [ ] Capture matching native Low/Medium/High/Ultra reference views and record the exact
  relationship between `grid_size`, `cloud_mesh_size`, distance scale, and world coverage.
- [ ] Add failing origin/count/distance tests from that evidence, including negative coordinates,
  period crossings, and edge-fog coverage.
- [ ] Replace fixed 3x3 origins with the calibrated config-driven mapping while retaining one
  instanced draw and immutable geometry.
- [ ] Verify focused/full render and client suites, review, commit, and push.

### Task 6: Release live parity acceptance

- [ ] Rebuild ignored assets using the exact local cloud override and record only hashes and
  source version, never the path or bytes.
- [ ] Run BDS/core/release client with FIFO first. Capture temporary GDI views below, above,
  within, grazing, period crossings, and negative coordinates; compare against matching native.
- [ ] Prove no opaque slabs/edge pop/black rectangles, one steady draw, zero steady uploads,
  exact asset/shader identities, and correct weather/day-night response.
- [ ] Record actual CPU, RSS, frame-time, and teleport/remesh values. Do not close Phase 2.7 if
  any existing motion-artifact or two-second publication gate remains red.
- [ ] Update `plan.md`, independently review the evidence, commit, and push.
